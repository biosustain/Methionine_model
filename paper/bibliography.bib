	abstract = {Abstract Multi-omics datasets are becoming of key importance to
	            drive discovery in fundamental research as much as generating
	            knowledge for applied biotechnology. However, the construction of
	            such large datasets is usually time-consuming and expensive.
	            Automation is needed to overcome these issues by streamlining
	            workflows from sample generation to data analysis. Here, we
	            describe the construction of a complex workflow for the
	            generation of high-throughput microbial multi-omics datasets. The
	            workflow comprises a custom-built platform for automated
	            cultivation and sampling of microbes, sample preparation
	            protocols, analytical methods for sample analysis and automated
	            scripts for raw data processing. We demonstrate possibilities and
	            limitations of such workflow in generating data for three
	            biotechnologically relevant model organisms, namely Escherichia
	            coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Pseudomonas putida .},

	abstract = {Over the last 25 years, several mathematical models of
	            erythrocyte metabolism have been developed. Although these models
	            have identified the key features in the regulation and control of
	            erythrocyte metabolism, many important aspects remain
	            unexplained. In particular, none of these models have
	            satisfactorily accounted for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)
	            metabolism. 2,3-BPG is an important modulator of haemoglobin
	            oxygen affinity, and hence an understanding of the regulation of
	            2,3-BPG concentration is important for understanding blood oxygen
	            transport. A detailed, comprehensive, and hence realistic
	            mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism is presented that
	            can explain the regulation and control of 2,3-BPG concentration
	            and turnover. The model is restricted to the core metabolic
	            pathways, namely glycolysis, the 2,3-BPG shunt and the pentose
	            phosphate pathway (PPP), and includes membrane transport of
	            metabolites, the binding of metabolites to haemoglobin and Mg(2+)
	            , as well as pH effects on key enzymic reactions and binding
	            processes. The model is necessarily complex, since it is intended
	            to describe the regulation and control of 2,3-BPG metabolism
	            under a wide variety of physiological and experimental
	            conditions. In addition, since H(+) and blood oxygen tension are
	            important external effectors of 2,3-BPG concentration, it was
	            important that the model take into account the large array of
	            kinetic and binding phenomena that result from changes in these
	            effectors. Through an iterative loop of experimental and
	            simulation analysis many values of enzyme-kinetic parameters of
	            the model were refined to yield close conformity between model
	            simulations and 'real' experimental data. This iterative process
	            enabled a single set of parameters to be found which described
	            well the metabolic behaviour of the erythrocyte under a wide
	            variety of conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used cell factory;
	            therefore, it is important to understand how it organizes key
	            functional parts when cultured under different conditions. Here,
	            we perform a multiomics analysis of S. cerevisiae by culturing
	            the strain with a wide range of specific growth rates using
	            glucose as the sole limiting nutrient. Under these different
	            conditions, we measure the absolute transcriptome, the absolute
	            proteome, the phosphoproteome, and the metabolome. Most
	            functional protein groups show a linear dependence on the
	            specific growth rate. Proteins engaged in translation show a
	            perfect linear increase with the specific growth rate, while
	            glycolysis and chaperone proteins show a linear decrease under
	            respiratory conditions. Glycolytic enzymes and chaperones,
	            however, show decreased phosphorylation with increasing specific
	            growth rates; at the same time, an overall increased flux through
	            these pathways is observed. Further analysis show that even
	            though mRNA levels do not correlate with protein levels for all
	            individual genes, the transcriptome level of functional groups
	            correlates very well with its corresponding proteome. Finally,
	            using enzyme-constrained genome-scale modeling, we find that
	            enzyme usage plays an important role in controlling flux in amino
	            acid biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that the in vitro tyrosine
	            phosphorylation of the human erythrocyte anion transporter, band
	            3, prevented the binding of various glycolytic enzymes to the N
	            terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. Since these enzymes are
	            inhibited in their bound state, the functional consequences of
	            band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the red cell should be to
	            activate the enzymes and elevate glycolysis. We searched for
	            various enhancers of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation using a
	            novel assay designed to measure the phosphotyrosine levels at the
	            band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation/glycolytic enzyme-binding site.
	            This assay measures the extent of phosphorylation of a synthetic
	            band 3 peptide entrapped within resealed red cells. Using this
	            assay, three distinct compounds, all mild oxidants, were found to
	            stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3. All three
	            compounds were also found to elevate glycolytic rates in intact

	            to coordinately prevent these agents from stimulating both band 3
	            tyrosine phosphorylation and erythrocyte glycolysis. These
	            results suggest a possible function for a protein tyrosine kinase

	            Data Resource. BRENDA provides reliable data, continuous curation
	            and updates of classified enzymes, and the integration of newly
	            discovered enzymes. The main part contains \&gt;5 million data
	            for ∼90 000 enzymes from ∼13 000 organisms, manually extracted
	            from ∼157 000 primary literature references, combined with
	            information of text and data mining, data integration, and
	            prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data,
	            protein sequences, 3D structures, genome annotations, ligand
	            information, taxonomic, bibliographic, and kinetic data. BRENDA
	            offers an easy access to enzyme information from quick to
	            advanced searches, text- and structured-based queries for
	            enzyme-ligand interactions, word maps, and visualization of
	            enzyme data. The BRENDA Pathway Maps are completely revised and

	            to each individual enzyme. A new protein structure 3D viewer was
	            integrated. The prediction of the intracellular localization of

	            relations, rendering them essential for understanding, predicting
	            and optimizing the behaviour of living organisms. However, due to
	            the lack of kinetic data, traditional kinetic modelling often
	            yields only a few or no kinetic models with desirable dynamical
	            properties, making the analysis unreliable and computationally
	            inefficient. We present REKINDLE (Reconstruction of Kinetic
	            Models using Deep Learning), a deep-learning-based framework for
	            efficiently generating kinetic models with dynamic properties
	            matching the ones observed in cells. We showcase REKINDLE’s
	            capabilities to navigate through the physiological states of
	            metabolism using small numbers of data with significantly lower
	            computational requirements. The results show that data-driven

	            structure of metabolic networks and generate kinetic models with
	            tailored properties and statistical diversity. We anticipate that

	abstract = {Background SAGM is currently the standard additive solution used
	            in Europe, while AS-3 is the third additive solution that has
	            been licensed in the USA, and is also the one used in part of
	            Canada. Although AS-3 is based on a saline-adenine-glucose
	            solution, it also contains citrate and phosphate. Storage of red
	            blood cell concentrates in CPD-SAGM is known to lead to the
	            accumulation of a wide series of storage lesions, including
	            membrane protein fragmentation and vesiculation, as we could
	            previously determine through 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
	            Materials and methods. Through 2D-SDS-IEF-polyacrilamide gel
	            electrophoresis we performed a time course analysis (day 0, 21
	            and 42 of storage) of red blood cell membranes from
	            leukocyte-filtered concentrates either stored in CPD-SAGM or
	            CP2D-AS-3. Results and discussion. From the present study it
	            emerges that the membrane protein profile of red blood cells
	            stored in presence of AS-3 appears to be slightly different from
	            (better than) previous reports on SAGM-stored counterparts.
	            However, the increase of total membrane spot number due to the
	            presence of fragments at day 21 and the significant decrease at
	            day 42 are suggestive of a universal phenomenon which is not
	            efficiently tackled by either of the two additive solutions
	            investigated in the present study. Conclusion To further delve
	            into the storage lesion issue for RBCs stored in AS-3, it would
	            be interesting in the future to assay metabolic changes over
	            storage progression as well.},

	            relatively simple metabolic network compared to other human cell
	            types. Recent proteomics reports challenge the notion that RBCs
	            are mere hemoglobin carriers with limited metabolic activity.
	            Expanding our understanding of RBC metabolism has key
	            implications in many biomedical areas, including transfusion
	            medicine. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In-gel digestion coupled with
	            mass spectrometric analysis proteomics approaches were combined
	            with state-of-the-art tracing experiments by incubating
	            leukofiltered RBCs in additive solution-3 for up to 42 days under
	            blood bank conditions, in presence of 13C1,2,3-glucose, 2,2,4,
	            4-d-citrate, and 13C,15N-glutamine. RESULTS Results indicate that
	            the pentose phosphate pathway/glycolysis ratio increases during
	            storage in additive solution-3. While the majority of supernatant
	            glucose is consumed to fuel glycolysis, incorporation of
	            glucose-derived pentose phosphate moieties was observed in
	            nucleoside monophosphates. Incubation with deuterated citrate
	            indicated that citrate uptake and metabolism contribute to
	            explain the origin of up to approximately 20\% to 30\% lactate
	            that could not be explained by glucose oxidation and 2,
	            3-diphosphoglycerate consumption alone. Incubation with 13C,
	            15N-glutamine showed that glutaminolysis fuels transamination
	            reactions and accumulation of millimolar levels of 5-oxoproline,

	            other substrates than glucose, such as citrate, an observation
	            relevant to transfusion medicine (i.e., formulation of novel

	abstract = {Background Cell simulation, which aims to predict the complex
	            and dynamic behavior of living cells, is becoming a valuable
	            tool. In silico models of human red blood cell (RBC) metabolism
	            have been developed by several laboratories. An RBC model using
	            the E-Cell simulation system has been developed. This prototype
	            model consists of three major metabolic pathways, namely, the
	            glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the
	            nucleotide metabolic pathway. Like the previous model by Joshi
	            and Palsson, it also models physical effects such as osmotic
	            balance. This model was used here to reconstruct the pathology
	            arising from hereditary glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
	            deficiency, which is the most common deficiency in human RBC.
	            Results Since the prototype model could not reproduce the state
	            of G6PD deficiency, the model was modified to include a pathway
	            for de novo glutathione synthesis and a glutathione disulfide
	            (GSSG) export system. The de novo glutathione (GSH) synthesis
	            pathway was found to compensate partially for the lowered GSH
	            concentrations resulting from G6PD deficiency, with the result
	            that GSSG could be maintained at a very low concentration due to
	            the active export system. Conclusion The results of the
	            simulation were consistent with the estimated situation of real
	            G6PD-deficient cells. These results suggest that the de novo
	            glutathione synthesis pathway and the GSSG export system play an
	            important role in alleviating the consequences of G6PD
	            deficiency.},

	            limits the construction of large metabolic models. Given measured
	            metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme
	            concentrations, these constants may be inferred by model fitting,
	            but the estimation problems are hard to solve if models are
	            large. Here we show how consistent kinetic constants, metabolite
	            concentrations, and enzyme concentrations can be determined from
	            data if metabolic fluxes are known. The estimation method, called
	            model balancing, can handle models with a wide range of rate laws
	            and accounts for thermodynamic constraints between fluxes,
	            kinetic constants, and metabolite concentrations. It can be used
	            to estimate in-vivo kinetic constants, to complete and adjust
	            available data, and to construct plausible metabolic states with
	            predefined flux distributions. By omitting one term from the log
	            posterior—a term for penalising low enzyme concentrations—we
	            obtain a convex optimality problem with a unique local optimum.
	            As a demonstrative case, we balance a model of E. coli central
	            metabolism with artificial or experimental data and obtain a
	            physically and biologically plausible parameterisation of
	            reaction kinetics in E. coli central metabolism. The example
	            shows what information about kinetic constants can be obtained
	            from omics data and reveals practical limits to estimating
	            in-vivo kinetic constants. While noise-free omics data allow for
	            a reasonable reconstruction of in-vivo kcat and KM values,
	            prediction from noisy omics data are worse. Hence, adjusting

	            issue that calls for pragmatic approaches that take advantage of
	            both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The elegance of Bayesian
	            methodology is founded in the propagation of information content
	            provided by experimental data and prior assumptions to the
	            posterior probability distribution of model predictions. However,
	            for complex applications, experimental data and prior assumptions
	            potentially constrain the posterior probability distribution
	            insufficiently. In these situations, Bayesian Markov chain Monte
	            Carlo sampling can be infeasible. From a frequentist point of
	            view, insufficient experimental data and prior assumptions can be
	            interpreted as non-identifiability. The profile-likelihood

	            biological methylating agent. Methionine used for AdoMet
	            synthesis can be replenished via remethylation of homocysteine.
	            Alternatively, homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the
	            transsulfuration pathway. Aberrations in methionine metabolism
	            are associated with a number of complex diseases, including
	            cancer, anemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. The concentration
	            of methionine in blood and in organs is tightly regulated. Liver
	            plays a key role in buffering blood methionine levels, and an
	            interesting feature of its metabolism is that parallel tracks
	            exist for the synthesis and utilization of AdoMet. To elucidate
	            the molecular mechanism that controls metabolic fluxes in liver
	            methionine metabolism, we have studied the dependencies of AdoMet

	            increase in [Met] but rise sharply (,10-fold) in the narrow Met

	            using a mathematical model reveals that the sharp increase in
	            [AdoMet] and the methionine consumption rate observed within the
	            trigger zone are associated with metabolic switching from
	            methionine conservation to disposal, regulated allosterically by
	            switching between parallel pathways. This regulatory switch is
	            triggered by [Met] and provides a mechanism for stabilization of

	            of methionine in blood and in organs is tightly regulated. Liver
	            plays a key role in buffering blood methionine levels, and an
	            interesting feature of its metabolism is that parallel tracks
	            exist for the synthesis and utilization of AdoMet. To elucidate
	            the molecular mechanism that controls metabolic fluxes in liver
	            methionine metabolism, we have studied the dependencies of AdoMet
	            concentration and methionine consumption rate on methionine
	            concentration in native murine hepatocytes at physiologically
	            relevant concentrations (40–400 mM). We find that both [AdoMet]
	            and methionine consumption rates do not change gradually with an
	            increase in [Met] but rise sharply (,10-fold) in the narrow Met
	            interval from 50 to 100 mM. Analysis of our experimental data
	            using a mathematical model reveals that the sharp increase in
	            [AdoMet] and the methionine consumption rate observed within the
	            trigger zone are associated with metabolic switching from
	            methionine conservation to disposal, regulated allosterically by
	            switching between parallel pathways. This regulatory switch is
	            triggered by [Met] and provides a mechanism for stabilization of
	            methionine levels in blood over wide variations in dietary
	            methionine intake.},

	abstract = {Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) is the first enzyme

	            is often considered to be irreversible. However, its apparent
	            irreversibility is caused by the rapid removal of the immediate
	            product, 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone. We have now investigated
	            the reverse G-6-PD reaction, namely, the oxidation of reduced
	            nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) by
	            6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone to form glucose-6-phosphate and
	            nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The substrate
	            of the reaction, 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone, was rapidly
	            generated from glucose-6-phosphate and NADP. The lactone was
	            stabilized by addition of perchloric acid. A substrate analogue,
	            6-phosphoglucono-gamma-lactone, was synthesized by dehydrating
	            6-phosphogluconic acid. At pH 2.3 the t 1/2 of the delta-lactone
	            was 2.4 hours; that of the gamma-lactone was 57 hours. The
	            following kinetic parameters were established: Km delta-lactone
	            1027 +/- 183 mumol/L; Km gamma-lactone 266 +/- 71 mumol/L; Km
	            NADPH less than 10 mumol/L; ratio of the Vmax G-6-PD
	            forward/reverse reaction 2.0. Glucose-6-phosphate was found to be
	            a competitive inhibitor with both lactones in the reverse G-6-PD
	            reaction. Genetic mutants of humans in which the Km of G-6-PD for
	            glucose-6-phosphate was diminished also had a diminished Km for
	            6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone. Thus, it appears that the same
	            active site on the enzyme binds glucose-6-phosphate in the
	            forward reaction and 6-phosphogluconolactone in the reverse

	            The vaccine is listed in the World Health Organisation list of

	            cheaply in the developing world for less than one US Dollar per

	            a deeper understanding of the parameters that determine C. tetani
	            virulence and physiological behaviour in bioreactors. Here, we
	            compared a traditional fermentation process with a fermentation
	            medium supplemented with five heavily consumed amino acids. The
	            experiment demonstrated that amino acid catabolism plays a key

	            Overall, the fermentation map shows that, mediated by free amino

	            hematologic disorders, hormonal dysregulation, cancers,
	            infectious diseases and genetic disorders. The technologies
	            behind their production have changed substantially since
	            biotherapeutic proteins were first approved in the 1980s.
	            Although most biotherapeutic proteins developed to date have been
	            produced using the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary and murine
	            myeloma (NS0, Sp2/0) cell lines, there has been a recent shift
	            toward the use of human cell lines. One of the most important
	            advantages of using human cell lines for protein production is
	            the greater likelihood that the resulting recombinant protein
	            will bear post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are
	            consistent with those seen on endogenous human proteins. Although
	            other mammalian cell lines can produce PTMs similar to human
	            cells, they also produce non-human PTMs, such as galactose-a1,
	            3-galactose and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, which are potentially
	            immunogenic. In addition, human cell lines are grown easily in a
	            serum-free suspension culture, reproduce rapidly and have
	            efficient protein production. A possible disadvantage of using
	            human cell lines is the potential for humanspecific viral
	            contamination, although this risk can be mitigated with multiple
	            viral inactivation or clearance steps. In addition, while human
	            cell lines are currently widely used for biopharmaceutical
	            research, vaccine production and production of some licensed
	            protein therapeutics, there is a relative paucity of clinical
	            experience with human cell lines because they have only recently
	            begun to be used for the manufacture of proteins (compared with
	            other types of cell lines). With additional research investment,
	            human cell lines may be further optimized for routine commercial
	            production of a broader range of biotherapeutic proteins.},

	abstract = {Background Cell line-specific, genome-scale metabolic models
	            enable rigorous and systematic in silico investigation of
	            cellular metabolism. Such models have recently become available
	            for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, a key ingredient,
	            namely an experimentally validated biomass function that
	            summarizes the cellular composition, was so far missing. Here, we
	            close this gap by providing extensive experimental data on the
	            biomass composition of 13 parental and producer CHO cell lines
	            under various conditions. Results We report total protein, lipid,
	            DNA, RNA and carbohydrate content, cell dry mass, and detailed
	            protein and lipid composition. Furthermore, we present meticulous
	            data on exchange rates between cells and environment and provide
	            detailed experimental protocols on how to determine all of the
	            above. The biomass composition is converted into cell line- and
	            condition-specific biomass functions for use in cell
	            line-specific, genome-scale metabolic models of CHO. Finally,
	            flux balance analysis (FBA) is used to demonstrate consistency
	            between in silico predictions and experimental analysis.
	            Conclusions Our study reveals a strong variability of the total
	            protein content and cell dry mass across cell lines. However, the
	            relative amino acid composition is independent of the cell line
	            and condition and thus needs not be explicitly measured for each
	            new cell line. In contrast, the lipid composition is strongly
	            influenced by the growth media and thus will have to be
	            determined in each case. These cell line-specific variations in
	            biomass composition have a small impact on growth rate
	            predictions with FBA, as inaccuracies in the predictions are
	            rather dominated by inaccuracies in the exchange rate spectra.
	            Cell-specific biomass variations only become important if the
	            experimental errors in the exchange rate spectra drop below

	abstract = {Cells respond to countless external cues using a limited
	            repertoire of interconnected pathways that are activated by
	            G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent
	            discoveries changed our perception of the signal specificity and
	            showed that distinct spatio-temporal activation profiles of the
	            same effectors result in diverse physiological
	            responses.Computational models have emerged as a novel tool to
	            provide insights into the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns
	            of signalling responses. Mechanistic models of the
	            epidermal-growth-factor-receptor network have created in silico
	            replicas of signalling dynamics and generated experimentally
	            testable hypotheses.Universal motifs of signalling networks are
	            protein-modification cycles that are catalysed by opposing
	            enzymes, such as a kinase and a phosphatase, or a guanine
	            nucleotide exchange factor and a GTPase-activating protein.
	            Modelling reveals how cycles and cascades process and integrate
	            signals, and which feedback architecture enables robustness,
	            linear or ultrasensitive responses, bistability and
	            oscillations.Complex dynamics arise from simple basic motifs. Two
	            or more phosphorylation sites potentially lead to bistability. A
	            simple one-site modification cycle can turn into a bistable
	            switch by four different destabilizing mechanisms; an extra
	            stabilizing feedback loop can render this bistable switch into a
	            relaxation oscillator by 32 distinct designs.Cells have developed
	            mechanisms for precise sensing of their positional information.
	            Intracellular gradients of protein activities arise from the
	            spatial separation of opposing reactions in protein-modification
	            cycles. These gradients provide positional cues for mitosis,
	            motility and migration.In signalling pathways, including
	            mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, the membrane
	            confinement of a kinase and the cytosolic localization of
	            phosphatases can result in precipitous gradients of
	            phosphorylated signal-transducers that spread solely by
	            diffusion. Endocytotic trafficking of phosphorylated kinases and
	            travelling waves of protein phosphorylation can propagate
	            phosphorylation signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus,
	            especially in large cells, such as Xenopus eggs.Rapid survival
	            signals in neurons might be transmitted by waves of protein
	            phosphorylation that emerge from kinase/phosphatase cascades,
	            such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase, the
	            phosphatidylinositol–3 kinase-AKT/protein kinase B and GTPase

	            concentration, being an exponential growth phase and a stationary

	            observed during which the cell division comes to a halt but the
	            cell growth continues in the form of an increase in cell size.
	            The cell size increase (SI) phase occurs between the exponential
	            proliferation phase (also called the number increase or NI phase)
	            and the stationary phase. During the SI phase, the average volume
	            and dry weight per cell increase threefold linearly with time.
	            The average mAb specific productivity per cell increases linearly
	            with the cell volume and therefore is on average two times higher
	            in the SI phase than in the NI phase. The specific essential

	            between the NI and the SI phase, which agrees with the similar
	            biomass production rate per cell between these two phases.
	            Accumulation of fatty acids and formation of lipid droplets in
	            the cells are observed during the SI phase, indicating that the

	            Here, we report the results of our molecular dynamics studies on

	            increasing the pool of glycolytic biosynthetic intermediates, and

	            microenvironment, the Warburg Effect is important for the growth
	            and proliferation of tumor cells. The mechanisms by which a cell
	            acquires the Warburg Effect phenotype are regulated by the
	            expression of numerous oncogenes, including oncogenic tyrosine
	            kinases. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases play a significant role in
	            phosphorylating and regulating the activity of numerous metabolic
	            enzymes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes increases
	            the activities of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, thus

	            Paradoxically however, tyrosine phosphorylation of pyruvate

	            seldom investigated. We, however, recently showed that inhibiting

	            endothelium-derived relaxing factor- and second
	            messenger-independent manner. Here we assessed the role of G6PD
	            in regulating CA contractility. Treating bovine CAs for 20 min
	            with potassium chloride (KCl; 30 mM), amphotericin B (50 μM), or
	            U46619 (100 nM) significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) increased both

	            pathway. The effect was Ca2+ independent, and there was a
	            corresponding increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity.
	            Activation of G6PD by KCl was blocked by the PKCδ inhibitor
	            rottlerin (10 μM) or by knocking down PKCδ expression using
	            siRNA. Phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (10 μM), a PKC activator,
	            significantly increased G6PD phosphorylation and activity,

	            at sites flanking the G6PD active site significantly inhibited
	            phosphorylation, shifted the isoelectric point, and reduced
	            enzyme activity. Knocking down G6PD decreased NADPH and reactive
	            oxygen species generation, and reduced KCl-evoked increases in
	            [Ca2+]i and myosin light chain phosphorylation, thereby reducing

	            developed less KCl/phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate-evoked force than
	            those from their wild-type littermates. Conversely,

	            can act as an autoinhibitor by blocking substrate access to the

	            and catalysis. While this model has been widely invoked, it was

	abstract = {CHO cells have become the favorite expression system for large
	            scale production of complex biopharmaceuticals. However,
	            industrial strategies for upstream process development are based
	            on empirical results, due to a lack of fundamental understanding
	            of intracellular activities. Genome scale models of CHO cells
	            have been reconstructed to provide an economical way of analyzing
	            and interpreting large-omics datasets, since they add cellular
	            context to the data. Here the most recently available CHO-DG44
	            genome-scale specific model was manually curated and tailored to
	            the metabolic profile of cell lines used for industrial protein
	            production, by modifying 601 reactions. Generic changes were
	            applied to simplify the model and cope with missing constraints
	            related to regulatory effects as well as thermodynamic and
	            osmotic forces. Cell line specific changes were related to the
	            metabolism of high-yielding production cell lines. The model was
	            semi-constrained with 24 metabolites measured on a daily basis in
	            n = 4 independent industrial 2L fed batch cell culture processes
	            for a therapeutic antibody production. This study is the first
	            adaptation of a genome scale model for CHO cells to an industrial
	            process, that successfully predicted cell phenotype. The tailored
	            model predicted accurately both the exometabolomics data (r2 ≥
	            0.8 for 96\% of the considered metabolites) and growth rate (r2 =
	            0.91) of the industrial cell line. Flux distributions at
	            different days of the process were analyzed for validation and
	            suggestion of strategies for medium optimization. This study
	            shows how to adapt a genome scale model to an industrial process
	            and sheds light on the metabolic specificities of a high
	            production process. The curated genome scale model is a great
	            tool to gain insights into intracellular fluxes and to identify
	            possible bottlenecks impacting cell performances during
	            production process. The general use of genome scale models for
	            modeling industrial recombinant cell lines is a long-term
	            investment that will highly benefit process development and speed
	            up time to market.},

	            cells has been an area of intense investigation over the last 3
	            decades as a means to improve these cell factories as producers
	            of high quality recombinant therapeutic proteins. Metabolically,
	            the cultivation of CHO cells is characterised by the rapid
	            consumption of the primary carbon and energy sources, glucose and
	            glutamine, with lactate and ammonia produced as by-products,
	            respectively. In the context of bioprocess-relevant CHO cell
	            phenotypes, glycolytic metabolism predominates during exponential
	            cell growth culminating in lactate production while glucose
	            channelling through the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle supports
	            high-specific productivity. The genetic diversity inherent among
	            CHO cell lineages (CHO-K1, CHO-S, and CHO-DG44), in addition to
	            clonal isolates, makes media development a complex task which
	            must often be performed on a clone by clone basis. However,
	            designing tailored media formulations and sophisticated feeding
	            regimens based on empirical observation has been one of the main
	            driving forces behind the enhancements seen today in volumetric
	            titres. To add to this complexity, CHO mitochondrial genetics
	            have recently been shown to be heterogeneous resulting in an
	            additional level of genetic pre-programming at the epicentre of
	            cellular energy production. Cajoling CHO cells to utilise

	            strategies, hypothermic adaptation or genetic engineering are
	            areas of considerable interest within the biopharmaceutical
	            community. Genetic re-programming of cellular metabolism through
	            the manipulation of desirable metabolic pathways using microRNAs,
	            siRNAs or gene overexpression have yielded some success. With the
	            advent of sophisticated gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, a
	            better understanding of CHO cell metabolism should drive
	            knowledge-based multi-faceted cell line development pipelines
	            combining both genetic engineering, selection of innately
	            superior clones as well as tailored media formulations to improve

	            possibilities for protein–protein interactions, conformational
	            regulation, and phosphorylation pathways. However, there is at
	            present no comprehensive picture of how these factors shape the
	            response of a protein's phosphorylation state to changes in

	            theory for the regulation of multisite protein phosphorylation
	            based on the mechanistic description of elementary binding and
	            catalytic steps. Explicit solutions for the steady-state response
	            curves and characteristic (de)phosphorylation times have been

	            systematic kinetic analysis of a phosphorylation cycle that
	            starts from the description of elementary protein–protein
	            interaction and catalytic steps. A rapid-equilibrium
	            approximation for protein interactions is used to reduce the set
	            of parameters. The resulting description consists of a kinetic
	            equation for the phosphorylation of the target and a set of
	            conservation conditions for kinase and phosphatase. Generally no
	            explicit rate laws exist for the two enzymes; linear or
	            Michaelis–Menten rate equations can be obtained in special cases.
	            Key parameters that determine the stimulus–response curve and the
	            response time of the cycle are the concentrations of kinase and

	            previously undescribed biphasic response. Two kinds of
	            competition effect turn out to shape the behaviour: (1) the

	            is paradoxical pleiotropy: the same secreted signaling molecule
	            can induce opposite effects in the responding cells. For example,
	            the cytokine IL-2 can promote proliferation and death of T cells.
	            The role of such paradoxical signaling remains unclear. To
	            address this, we studied CD4+ T cell expansion in culture. We
	            found that cells with a 30-fold difference in initial
	            concentrations reached a homeostatic concentration nearly
	            independent of initial cell levels. Below an initial threshold,
	            cell density decayed to extinction (OFF-state). We show that
	            these dynamics relate to the paradoxical effect of IL-2, which
	            increases the proliferation rate cooperatively and the death rate
	            linearly. Mathematical modeling explained the observed cell and
	            cytokine dynamics and predicted conditions that shifted cell fate
	            from homeostasis to the OFF-state. We suggest that paradoxical
	            signaling provides cell circuits with specific dynamical features
	            that are robust to environmental perturbations.},

	            become clinically impactful, sufficient high quality iPSCs in
	            quantity must be generated, a task that exceeds current
	            capabilities. In this study, K3 iPSCs cultures were examined
	            using parallel-labeling metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) to
	            quantify intracellular fluxes at relevant bioprocessing stages:
	            glucose concentrations representative of initial media
	            concentrations and high lactate concentrations representative of
	            fed-batch culture conditions, prior to and after bolus glucose
	            feeds. The glucose and lactate concentrations are also
	            representative of concentrations that might be encountered at
	            different locations within 3D cell aggregates. Furthermore, a
	            novel method was developed to allow the isotopic tracer [U-13C3]
	            lactate to be used in the 13C-MFA model. The results indicated
	            that high extracellular lactate concentrations decreased glucose
	            consumption and lactate production, while glucose concentrations
	            alone did not affect rates of aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, for
	            the high lactate cultures, lactate was used as a metabolic

	            results demonstrate that iPSCs have metabolic flexibility and
	            possess the capacity to metabolize lactate to support exponential

	abstract = {Lactate is one of the key waste metabolites of mammalian cell
	            culture. High lactate levels are caused by high aerobic
	            glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, and are usually
	            associated with adverse culture performance. Therefore, reducing
	            lactate accumulation has been an ongoing challenge in the cell
	            culture development to improve growth, productivity, and process
	            robustness. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a
	            crucial role for the fate of pyruvate, as it converts pyruvate to
	            acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The PDC activity can be
	            indirectly increased by inhibiting the PDC inhibitor, pyruvate
	            dehydrogenase kinase, using dichloroacetate (DCA), resulting in
	            less pyruvate being available for lactate formation. Here,
	            Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultivated either with 5 mM DCA
	            or without DCA in various batch and fed-batch bioreactor
	            processes. In all cultures, DCA increased peak viable cell
	            density (VCD), culture length and final antibody titer. The
	            strongest effect was observed in a fed batch with media and
	            glucose feeding in which peak VCD was increased by more than 50\%
	            , culture length was extended by more than 3 days, and the final
	            antibody titer increased by more than twofold. In cultures with
	            DCA, lactate production and glucose consumption during
	            exponential growth were on average reduced by approximately 40\%
	            and 35\%, respectively. Metabolic flux analysis showed reduced
	            glycolytic fluxes, whereas fluxes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
	            cycle were not affected, suggesting that cultures with DCA use
	            glucose more efficiently. In a proteomics analysis, only few
	            proteins were identified as being differentially expressed,
	            indicating that DCA acts on a posttranslational level. Antibody
	            quality in terms of aggregation, charge variant, and
	            glycosylation pattern was unaffected. Subsequent bioreactor
	            experiments with sodium lactate and sodium chloride feeding
	            indicated that lower osmolality, rather than lower lactate
	            concentration itself, improved culture performance in DCA
	            cultures. In conclusion, the addition of DCA to the cell culture
	            improved culture performance and increased antibody titers

	            phosphate (NADPH) is a prerequisite of the overproduction of
	            isoprenoids and related bioproducts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
	            Although S. cerevisiae highly depends on the oxidative pentose
	            phosphate (PP) pathway to produce NADPH, its metabolic flux
	            toward the oxidative PP pathway is limited due to the rigid
	            glycolysis flux. To maximize NADPH supply for the isoprenoid
	            production in yeast, upper glycolytic metabolic fluxes are
	            reduced by introducing mutations into phosphofructokinase (PFK)
	            along with overexpression of ZWF1 encoding glucose-6-phosphate
	            (G6P) dehydrogenase. The PFK mutations (Pfk1 S724D and Pfk2
	            S718D) result in less glycerol production and more accumulation
	            of G6P, which is a gateway metabolite toward the oxidative PP
	            pathway. When combined with the PFK mutations, overexpression of
	            ZWF1 caused substantial increases of [NADPH]/[NADP+ ] ratios
	            whereas the effect of ZWF1 overexpression alone in the wild-type
	            strain is not noticeable. Also, the introduction of ZWF1
	            overexpression and the PFK mutations into engineered yeast
	            overexpressing acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (ERG10), truncated
	            HMG-CoA reductase isozyme 1 (tHMG1), and amorphadiene synthase
	            (ADS) leads to a titer of 497 mg L-1 of amorphadiene (3.7-fold
	            over the parental strain). These results suggest that
	            perturbation of upper glycolytic fluxes, in addition to ZWF1
	            overexpression, is necessary for efficient NADPH supply through

	            bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
	            from rat liver with extra material at both ends. Although the
	            yeast sequence is especially similar to the liver one in its
	            bisphosphatase domain, the essential His-258 of the liver enzyme
	            is, in yeast, a serine, which may explain the apparent lack of
	            bisphosphatase activity. Also, the yeast enzyme known to be
	            activated via protein kinase A, has a putative phosphorylation
	            site near its C-terminus and lacks the N-terminal phosphorylation
	            sequence involved in inhibition of the liver enzyme. In a

	            mutant strain grew well on glucose and contained a near-normal
	            level of fructose 2,6-P2. But in its growth on pyruvate, by
	            contrast with the wild-type strain, no fructose 2,6-P2 was

	            the pfk26 mutant strain in the absence of cycloheximide, on the

	            accumulation, presumably employing a glucose-inducible second

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A well known example of oscillatory phenomena is the
	            transient oscillations of glycolytic intermediates in
	            Saccharomyces cerevisiae, their regulation being predominantly
	            investigated by mathematical modeling. To our knowledge there has
	            not been a genetic approach to elucidate the regulatory role of
	            the different enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. RESULTS: We
	            report that the laboratory strain BY4743 could also be used to
	            investigate this oscillatory phenomenon, which traditionally has
	            been studied using S. cerevisiae X2180. This has enabled us to
	            employ existing isogenic deletion mutants and dissect the roles
	            of isoforms, or subunits of key glycolytic enzymes in glycolytic
	            oscillations. We demonstrate that deletion of TDH3 but not TDH2
	            and TDH1 (encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase:
	            GAPDH) abolishes NADH oscillations. While deletion of each of the
	            hexokinase (HK) encoding genes (HXK1 and HXK2) leads to
	            oscillations that are longer lasting with lower amplitude, the
	            effect of HXK2 deletion on the duration of the oscillations is
	            stronger than that of HXK1. Most importantly our results show
	            that the presence of beta (Pfk2) but not that of alpha subunits
	            (Pfk1) of the hetero-octameric enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK)
	            is necessary to achieve these oscillations. Furthermore, we
	            report that the cAMP-mediated PKA pathway (via some of its
	            components responsible for feedback down-regulation) modulates
	            the activity of glycoytic enzymes thus affecting oscillations.
	            Deletion of both PDE2 (encoding a high affinity
	            cAMP-phosphodiesterase) and IRA2 (encoding a GTPase activating
	            protein- Ras-GAP, responsible for inactivating Ras-GTP) abolished
	            glycolytic oscillations. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic approach to
	            characterising the glycolytic oscillations in yeast has
	            demonstrated differential roles of the two types of subunits of
	            PFK, and the isoforms of GAPDH and HK. Furthermore, it has shown
	            that PDE2 and IRA2, encoding components of the cAMP pathway
	            responsible for negative feedback regulation of PKA, are required
	            for glycolytic oscillations, suggesting an enticing link between
	            these cAMP pathway components and the glycolysis pathway enzymes
	            shown to have the greatest role in glycolytic oscillation. This
	            study suggests that a systematic genetic approach combined with
	            mathematical modelling can advance the study of oscillatory
	            phenomena.},

	abstract = {The ability of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to
	            rapidly increase its glycolytic flux upon a switch from
	            respiratory to fermentative sugar metabolism is an important
	            characteristic for many of its multiple industrial applications.
	            An increased glycolytic flux can be achieved by an increase in
	            the glycolytic enzyme capacities (V(max)) and/or by changes in
	            the concentrations of low-molecular-weight substrates, products,
	            and effectors. The goal of the present study was to understand
	            the time-dependent, multilevel regulation of glycolytic enzymes
	            during a switch from fully respiratory conditions to fully
	            fermentative conditions. The switch from glucose-limited aerobic
	            chemostat growth to full anaerobiosis and glucose excess resulted
	            in rapid acceleration of fermentative metabolism. Although the
	            capacities (V(max)) of the glycolytic enzymes did not change
	            until 45 min after the switch, the intracellular levels of
	            several substrates, products, and effectors involved in the
	            regulation of glycolysis did change substantially during the
	            initial 45 min (e.g., there was a buildup of the
	            phosphofructokinase activator fructose-2,6-bisphosphate). This
	            study revealed two distinct phases in the upregulation of
	            glycolysis upon a switch to fermentative conditions: (i) an
	            initial phase, in which regulation occurs completely through
	            changes in metabolite levels; and (ii) a second phase, in which
	            regulation is achieved through a combination of changes in V(max)
	            and metabolite concentrations. This multilevel regulation study
	            qualitatively explains the increase in flux through the
	            glycolytic enzymes upon a switch of S. cerevisiae to fermentative
	            conditions and provides a better understanding of the roles of
	            different regulatory mechanisms that influence the dynamics of
	            yeast glycolysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recurrent problem in genome-scale metabolic models
	            (GEMs) is to correctly represent lipids as biomass requirements,
	            due to the numerous of possible combinations of individual lipid
	            species and the corresponding lack of fully detailed data. In
	            this study we present SLIMEr, a formalism for correctly
	            representing lipid requirements in GEMs using commonly available
	            experimental data. RESULTS: SLIMEr enhances a GEM with
	            mathematical constructs where we Split Lipids Into Measurable
	            Entities (SLIME reactions), in addition to constraints on both
	            the lipid classes and the acyl chain distribution. By
	            implementing SLIMEr on the consensus GEM of Saccharomyces
	            cerevisiae, we can represent accurate amounts of lipid species,
	            analyze the flexibility of the resulting distribution, and
	            compute the energy costs of moving from one metabolic state to
	            another. CONCLUSIONS: The approach shows potential for better
	            understanding lipid metabolism in yeast under different

	            phophoketolase pathway from Aspergillus nidulans. Both strategies
	            improved the production of PHB. Integration of gapN encoding
	            NADP(+) -dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from
	            Streptococcus mutans into the genome enabled an increased supply
	            of NADPH resulting in a decrease in glycerol production and
	            increased production of PHB. The strategy that resulted in the

	            the phosphoketolase pathway to supply acetyl-CoA without the need

	            biopharmaceuticals, but the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an
	            important cell factory as it is used for production of several
	            large volume products. Insulin and insulin analogs are by far the
	            dominating biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast, and this will
	            increase as the global insulin market is expected to grow from
	            USD12B in 2011 to more than USD32B by 2018. Other important
	            biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast are human serum albumin,
	            hepatitis vaccines and virus like particles used for vaccination
	            against human papillomavirus. Here is given a brief overview of
	            biopharmaceutical production by yeast and it is discussed how the
	            secretory pathway can be engineered to ensure more efficient
	            protein production. The involvement of directed metabolic
	            engineering through the integration of tools from genetic
	            engineering, systems biology and mathematical modeling, is also

	abstract = {Over the last decades, yeast has become a key model organism for
	            the study of lipid biochemistry. Because the regulation of lipids
	            has been closely linked to various physiopathologies, the study
	            of these biomolecules could lead to new diagnostics and
	            treatments. Before the field can reach this point, however,
	            sufficient tools for integrating and analyzing the ever-growing
	            availability of lipidomics data will need to be developed. To
	            this end, genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolic networks are
	            useful tools, though their large size and complexity introduces
	            too much uncertainty in the accuracy of predicted outcomes.
	            Ideally, therefore, a model for studying lipids would contain
	            only the pathways required for the proper analysis of these
	            biomolecules, but would not be an ad hoc reduction. We hereby
	            present a metabolic model that focuses on lipid metabolism
	            constructed through the integration of detailed lipid pathways
	            into an already existing GEM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our
	            model was then systematically reduced around the subsystems
	            defined by these pathways to provide a more manageable model size
	            for complex studies. We show that this model is as consistent and
	            inclusive as other yeast GEMs regarding the focus and detail on
	            the lipid metabolism, and can be used as a scaffold for
	            integrating lipidomics data to improve predictions in studies of
	            lipid-related biological functions. FEMS 2020.},

	            cerevisiae and its subsequent optimisation is described.
	            Expression of proinsulin in S. cerevisiae does not result in
	            efficient secretion of proinsulin or insulin. However, expression
	            of a cDNA encoding a proinsulin-like molecule with deletion of
	            threonine(B30) as a fusion protein with the S. cerevisiae
	            alpha-factor prepro-peptide (leader), followed either by
	            replacement of the human proinsulin C-peptide with a small
	            C-peptide (e.g. AAK), or by direct fusion of lysine(B29) to
	            glycine(A1), results in the efficient secretion of folded
	            single-chain proinsulin-like molecules to the culture
	            supernatant. The secreted single-chain insulin precursor can then
	            be purified and subsequently converted to human insulin by
	            tryptic transpeptidation in organic aqueous medium in the
	            presence of a threonine ester. The leader confers secretory
	            competence to the insulin precursor, and constructed (synthetic)
	            leaders have been developed for efficient secretory expression of
	            the insulin precursor in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and Pichia
	            pastories. The Kex2 endoprotease, specific for dibasic sites,

	            precursor fusion protein is secreted to the culture supernatant
	            in a hyperglycosylated form. A spacer peptide localised between
	            the leader and the insulin precursor has been developed to

	            the hallmark constituents of Cannabis, and their analogues have
	            been investigated extensively for their potential medical
	            applications2. Certain cannabinoid formulations have been
	            approved as prescription drugs in several countries for the
	            treatment of a range of human ailments3. However, the study and
	            medicinal use of cannabinoids has been hampered by the legal
	            scheduling of Cannabis, the low in planta abundances of nearly
	            all of the dozens of known cannabinoids4, and their structural
	            complexity, which limits bulk chemical synthesis. Here we report
	            the complete biosynthesis of the major cannabinoids
	            cannabigerolic acid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid,
	            cannabidiolic acid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarinic acid and
	            cannabidivarinic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, from the

	            native mevalonate pathway to provide a high flux of geranyl
	            pyrophosphate and introduced a heterologous,
	            multi-organism-derived hexanoyl-CoA biosynthetic pathway5. We
	            also introduced the Cannabis genes that encode the enzymes
	            involved in the biosynthesis of olivetolic acid6, as well as the
	            gene for a previously undiscovered enzyme with
	            geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase activity and
	            the genes for corresponding cannabinoid synthases7,8. Furthermore

	            by abundance changes in metabolic enzymes. Associating

	abstract = {Introduction: Subcellular compartmentalization enables
	            eukaryotic cells to carry out different reactions at the same
	            time, resulting in different metabolite pools in the subcellular
	            compartments. Thus, mutations affecting the mitochondrial energy
	            metabolism could cause different metabolic alterations in
	            mitochondria compared to the cytoplasm. Given that the metabolite
	            pool in the cytosol is larger than that of other subcellular
	            compartments, metabolic profiling of total cells could miss these
	            compartment-specific metabolic alterations. Objectives: To reveal
	            compartment-specific metabolic differences, mitochondria and the
	            cytoplasmic fraction of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	            were isolated and subjected to metabolic profiling. Methods:
	            Mitochondria were isolated through differential centrifugation
	            and were analyzed together with the remaining cytoplasm by gas
	            chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolic
	            profiling. Results: Seventy-two metabolites were identified, of
	            which eight were found exclusively in mitochondria and sixteen
	            exclusively in the cytoplasm. Based on the metabolic signature of
	            mitochondria and of the cytoplasm, mutants of the succinate
	            dehydrogenase (respiratory chain complex II) and of the
	            FOF1-ATP-synthase (complex V) can be discriminated in both
	            compartments by principal component analysis from wild-type and
	            each other. These mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
	            machinery mutants altered not only citric acid cycle related
	            metabolites but also amino acids, fatty acids, purine and
	            pyrimidine intermediates and others. Conclusion: By applying
	            metabolomics to isolated mitochondria and the corresponding
	            cytoplasm, compartment-specific metabolic signatures can be
	            identified. This subcellular metabolomics analysis is a powerful

	            yeast glycolysis and showed that one of the most studied
	            biochemical pathways could not be quite understood in terms of
	            the kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes as measured in
	            cell extract. Moreover, when the same model was later applied to
	            different experimental steady-state conditions, it often
	            exhibited unrestrained metabolite accumulation.Here we resolve
	            this issue by showing that the results of such ab initio modeling
	            are improved substantially by (i) including appropriate
	            allosteric regulation and (ii) measuring the enzyme kinetic
	            parameters under conditions that resemble the intracellular

	            cerevisiae to optimize the precursor module of the aromatic amino
	            acid biosynthesis pathway, which is a rich resource for
	            synthesizing a great variety of chemicals ranging from polymer
	            precursor, to nutraceuticals and pain-relief drugs. To facilitate
	            the discovery of novel targets to enhance the pathway flux, we
	            incorporated the computational tool YEASTRACT for predicting
	            novel transcriptional repressors and OptForce strain-design for
	            identifying non-intuitive pathway interventions. The multilevel
	            approach consisted of (i) relieving the pathway from strong
	            transcriptional repression, (ii) removing competing pathways to
	            ensure high carbon capture, and (iii) rewiring precursor pathways
	            to increase the carbon funneling to the desired target. The
	            combination of these interventions led to the establishment of a
	            S. cerevisiae strain with shikimic acid (SA) titer reaching as
	            high as 2.5gL-1, 7-fold higher than the base strain. Further
	            expansion of the platform led to the titer of 2.7gL-1 of muconic
	            acid (MA) and its intermediate protocatechuic acid (PCA)
	            together. Both the SA and MA production platforms demonstrated
	            increases in titer and yield nearly 300\% from the previously
	            reported, highest-producing S. cerevisiae strains. Further
	            examination elucidated the diverged impacts of disrupting the
	            oxidative branch (ZWF1) of the pentose phosphate pathway on the
	            titers of desired products belonging to different portions of the
	            pathway. The investigation of other non-intuitive interventions
	            like the deletion of the Pho13 enzyme also revealed the important
	            role of the transaldolase in determining the fate of the carbon
	            flux in the pathways of study. This integrative approach
	            identified novel determinants at both transcriptional and
	            metabolic levels that constrain the flux entering the aromatic
	            amino acid pathway. In the future, this platform can be readily
	            used for engineering the downstream modules toward the production
	            of important plant-sourced aromatic secondary metabolites.

	            responding to environmental changes remain, however, unclear.
	            Here we examine this issue, using as a case study the rapid
	            decrease in pyruvate kinase flux in yeast upon glucose removal.
	            The main pyruvate kinase isozyme (Cdc19) is phosphorylated in
	            response to environmental cues. It also exhibits positively
	            cooperative (ultrasensitive) allosteric activation by fructose-1,
	            6-bisphosphate (FBP). Glucose removal causes accumulation of
	            Cdc19's substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. This response is retained
	            in strains with altered protein-kinase-A or
	            AMP-activated-protein-kinase activity or with CDC19 carrying
	            mutated phosphorylation sites. In contrast, yeast engineered with
	            a CDC19 point mutation that ablates FBP-based regulation fail to
	            accumulate phosphoenolpyruvate. They also fail to grow on ethanol
	            and slowly resume growth upon glucose upshift. Thus, while yeast
	            pyruvate kinase is covalently modified in response to glucose
	            availability, its activity is controlled almost exclusively by

	            Specifically, we overexpressed all three fatty acid biosynthesis
	            genes, namely acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), fatty acid synthase
	            1 (FAS1) and fatty acid synthase 2 (FAS2), in S. cerevisiae. When
	            coupled to triacylglycerol (TAG) production, the engineered

	            , a four-fold improvement over the control strain. Understanding
	            that TAG cannot be used directly as fuels, we also engineered S.
	            cerevisiae to produce drop-in fuels and chemicals. Altering the

	abstract = {Computational strain design protocols aim at the system-wide
	            identification of intervention strategies for the enhanced
	            production of biochemicals in microorganisms. Existing approaches
	            relying solely on stoichiometry and rudimentary constraint-based
	            regulation overlook the effects of metabolite concentrations and
	            substrate-level enzyme regulation while identifying metabolic
	            interventions. In this paper, we introduce k-OptForce, which
	            integrates the available kinetic descriptions of metabolic steps
	            with stoichiometric models to sharpen the prediction of
	            intervention strategies for improving the bio-production of a
	            chemical of interest. It enables identification of a minimal set
	            of interventions comprised of both enzymatic parameter changes
	            (for reactions with available kinetics) and reaction flux changes
	            (for reactions with only stoichiometric information). Application
	            of k-OptForce to the overproduction of L-serine in E. coli and
	            triacetic acid lactone (TAL) in S. cerevisiae revealed that the
	            identified interventions tend to cause less dramatic
	            rearrangements of the flux distribution so as not to violate
	            concentration bounds. In some cases the incorporation of kinetic
	            information leads to the need for additional interventions as
	            kinetic expressions render stoichiometry-only derived
	            interventions infeasible by violating concentration bounds,
	            whereas in other cases the kinetic expressions impart flux
	            changes that favor the overproduction of the target product
	            thereby requiring fewer direct interventions. A sensitivity
	            analysis on metabolite concentrations shows that the required
	            number of interventions can be significantly affected by changing
	            the imposed bounds on metabolite concentrations. Furthermore,
	            k-OptForce was capable of finding non-intuitive interventions
	            aiming at alleviating the substrate-level inhibition of key
	            enzymes in order to enhance the flux towards the product of
	            interest, which cannot be captured by stoichiometry-alone
	            analysis. This study paves the way for the integrated analysis of

	abstract = {The methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) is an
	            important epigenetic DNA modification in many bacteria, plants,
	            and mammals, but its relevance for important model organisms,
	            including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, is
	            still equivocal. By reporting the presence of 5-meC in a broad
	            variety of wild, laboratory, and industrial yeasts, a recent
	            study also challenged the dogma about the absence of DNA
	            methylation in yeast species. We would like to bring to attention
	            that the protocol used for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
	            involved hydrolysis of the DNA preparations. As this process
	            separates cytosine and 5-meC from the sugar phosphate backbone,
	            this method is unable to distinguish DNA- from RNA-derived 5-meC.
	            We employed an alternative LC-MS/MS protocol where by targeting
	            5-methyldeoxycytidine moieties after enzymatic digestion, only
	            5-meC specifically derived from DNA is quantified. This technique
	            unambiguously identified cytosine DNA methylation in Arabidopsis
	            thaliana (14.0\% of cytosines methylated), Mus musculus (7.6\%),
	            and Escherichia coli (2.3\%). Despite achieving a detection limit
	            at 250 attomoles (corresponding to {\textless}0.00002 methylated
	            cytosines per nonmethylated cytosine), we could not confirm any
	            cytosine DNA methylation in laboratory and industrial strains of
	            Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
	            Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces paradoxus, or Pichia
	            pastoris. The protocol however unequivocally confirmed DNA
	            methylation in adult Drosophila melanogaster at a value (0.034\%)
	            that is up to 2 orders of magnitude below the detection limit of
	            bisulphite sequencing. Thus, 5-meC is a rare DNA modification in
	            drosophila but absent in yeast.},

	            understanding the integrated molecular processes that underlie
	            normal and abnormal cellular states. The availability of
	            metabolomic data, in addition to new developments in the formal
	            description of dynamic states of networks, has enabled a new data
	            integration approach for building large-scale kinetic networks.
	            We show that dynamic network models can be constructed in a
	            scalable manner using metabolomic data mapped onto stoichiometric
	            models, resulting in mass action stoichiometric simulation (MA)
	            models. Enzymes and their various functional states are
	            represented explicitly as compounds, or nodes in a stoichiometric
	            network, within this formalism. Analyses and simulations of MA
	            models explicitly show that regulatory enzymes can control
	            dynamic states of networks in part by binding numerous
	            metabolites at multiple sites. Thus, network functional states

	            sugar-consuming organisms use the canonical
	            Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnass (EMP) glycolytic pathway. Prokaryotic
	            glucose metabolism is particularly diverse, including several
	            alternative glycolytic pathways, the most common of which is the
	            Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The prevalence of the ED pathway
	            is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per glucose–half as much
	            as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of prokaryotic

	            energy (ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required
	            to catalyze pathway flux. We introduce methods for analyzing

	            protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP
	            pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that
	            prokaryotes use different glycolytic pathways depending on their
	            energy supply. Specifically, energy-deprived anaerobes
	            overwhelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the EMP pathway,
	            whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and
	            even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how
	            protein costs can explain the use of alternative metabolic
	            strategies, this study illustrates a direct connection between an

	            million people and kills more than one million people annually.
	            Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of
	            multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
	            falciparum. Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines
	            are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria
	            awaits rigorous clinical testing. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene
	            lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family
	            Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly
	            effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in
	            short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers. Although
	            total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly, the
	            semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially
	            sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a
	            cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and

	            Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg
	            l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway

	            inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the
	            desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable
	            of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific
	            productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial
	            scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to

	            fluctuations, complicating production planning by ACT
	            manufacturers. A stable source of affordable artemisinin is

	            provide an efficient biosynthetic route to artemisinic acid, with
	            fermentation titres of 25 grams per litre of artemisinic acid.
	            Furthermore, we have developed a practical, efficient and

	abstract = {Large scale dynamical systems (e.g. many nonlinear coupled
	            differential equations) can often be summarized in terms of only
	            a few state variables (a few equations), a trait that reduces
	            complexity and facilitates exploration of behavioral aspects of
	            otherwise intractable models. High model dimensionality and
	            complexity makes symbolic, pen-and-paper model reduction tedious
	            and impractical, a difficulty addressed by recently developed
	            frameworks that computerize reduction. Symbolic work has the
	            benefit, however, of identifying both reduced state variables and
	            parameter combinations that matter most (effective parameters, "
	            inputs"); whereas current computational reduction schemes leave
	            the parameter reduction aspect mostly unaddressed. As the
	            interest in mapping out and optimizing complex input-output
	            relations keeps growing, it becomes clear that combating the
	            curse of dimensionality also requires efficient schemes for input
	            space exploration and reduction. Here, we explore systematic,
	            data-driven parameter reduction by means of effective parameter
	            identification, starting from current nonlinear manifoldlearning
	            techniques enabling state space reduction. Our approach aspires
	            to extend the data-driven determination of effective state
	            variables with the data-driven discovery of effective model
	            parameters, and thus to accelerate the exploration of
	            high-dimensional parameter spaces associated with complex models.

	            sensitivities. We propose a parameter classification scheme based
	            on how the sensitivities scale at long observation times. We show
	            that for oscillatory models, either with a limit cycle or a
	            strange attractor, sensitivities can become arbitrarily large,

	            role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free
	            parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial
	            obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo
	            biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting
	            them to other experimental data often yields large parameter
	            uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a
	            growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield
	            well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual
	            parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model
	            had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with
	            eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we
	            use a collection of models from the literature to test whether
	            such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we
	            find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of
	            sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this
	            sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular,
	            sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of
	            ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly
	            constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with
	            this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to
	            argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also
	            implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	            complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	            this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our
	            results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in
	            systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights
	            the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most fascinating properties of the
	            biotechnologically important organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
	            its ability to perform simultaneous respiration and fermentation
	            at high growth rate even under fully aerobic conditions. In the
	            present work, this Crabtree effect called phenomenon was
	            investigated in detail by comparative 13C metabolic flux analysis
	            of S. cerevisiae growing under purely oxidative,
	            respiro-fermentative and predominantly fermentative conditions.
	            RESULTS: The metabolic shift from oxidative to fermentative
	            growth was accompanied by complex changes of carbon flux
	            throughout the whole central metabolism. This involved a flux
	            redirection from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards
	            glycolysis, an increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase, the
	            fermentative pathways and malic enzyme, a flux decrease through
	            the TCA cycle, and a partial relocation of alanine biosynthesis
	            from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. S. cerevisiae exhibited a
	            by-pass of pyruvate dehydrogenase in all physiological regimes.
	            During oxidative growth this by-pass was mainly provided via
	            pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA
	            synthase and transport of acetyl-CoA into the mitochondrion.
	            During fermentative growth this route, however, was saturated due
	            to limited enzyme capacity. Under these conditions the cells
	            exhibited high carbon flux through a chain of reactions involving
	            pyruvate carboxylase, the oxaloacetate transporter and malic
	            enzyme. During purely oxidative growth the PPP alone was
	            sufficient to completely supply NADPH for anabolism. During
	            fermentation, it provided only 60 \% of the required NADPH.
	            CONCLUSION: We conclude that, in order to overcome the limited
	            capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae possesses
	            different metabolic by-passes to channel carbon into the
	            mitochondrion. This involves the conversion of cytosolic pyruvate
	            either into acetyl CoA or oxaloacetate followed by
	            intercompartmental transport of these metabolites. During
	            oxidative growth mainly the NAD specific isoforms of acetaldehyde
	            dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyze the
	            corresponding reactions in S. cerevisiae, whereas NADPH supply
	            under fermentative conditions involves significant contribution
	            of sources other than the PPP such as e. g. NADPH specific
	            acetaldehyde dehydrogenase or isocitrate dehydrogenase.},

	            addiction to ECM-induced signals is required for
	            anchorage-independent growth, a property of most malignant cells.
	            Detachment from ECM is associated with enhanced production of
	            reactive oxygen species (ROS) owing to altered glucose
	            metabolism. Here we identify an unconventional pathway that
	            supports redox homeostasis and growth during adaptation to
	            anchorage independence. We observed that detachment from
	            monolayer culture and growth as anchorage-independent tumour
	            spheroids was accompanied by changes in both glucose and
	            glutamine metabolism. Specifically, oxidation of both nutrients
	            was suppressed in spheroids, whereas reductive formation of
	            citrate from glutamine was enhanced. Reductive glutamine
	            metabolism was highly dependent on cytosolic isocitrate
	            dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), because the activity was suppressed in
	            cells homozygous null for IDH1 or treated with an IDH1 inhibitor.
	            This activity occurred in absence of hypoxia, a well-known
	            inducer of reductive metabolism. Rather, IDH1 mitigated
	            mitochondrial ROS in spheroids, and suppressing IDH1 reduced
	            spheroid growth through a mechanism requiring mitochondrial ROS.
	            Isotope tracing revealed that in spheroids, isocitrate/citrate
	            produced reductively in the cytosol could enter the mitochondria
	            and participate in oxidative metabolism, including oxidation by
	            IDH2. This generates NADPH in the mitochondria, enabling cells to
	            mitigate mitochondrial ROS and maximize growth. Neither IDH1 nor
	            IDH2 was necessary for monolayer growth, but deleting either one
	            enhanced mitochondrial ROS and reduced spheroid size, as did
	            deletion of the mitochondrial citrate transporter protein.
	            Together, the data indicate that adaptation to anchorage
	            independence requires a fundamental change in citrate metabolism,
	            initiated by IDH1-dependent reductive carboxylation and
	            culminating in suppression of mitochondrial ROS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to adjust
	            to external oxygen availability by utilizing both respirative and
	            fermentative metabolic modes. Adjusting the metabolic mode
	            involves alteration of the intracellular metabolic fluxes that
	            are determined by the cell's multilevel regulatory network.
	            Oxygen is a major determinant of the physiology of S. cerevisiae
	            but understanding of the oxygen dependence of intracellular flux
	            distributions is still scarce. RESULTS: Metabolic flux
	            distributions of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A growing in
	            glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1
	            with 20.9\%, 2.8\%, 1.0\%, 0.5\% or 0.0\% O2 in the inlet gas
	            were quantified by 13C-MFA. Metabolic flux ratios from fractional
	            [U-13C]glucose labelling experiments were used to solve the
	            underdetermined MFA system of central carbon metabolism of S.
	            cerevisiae.While ethanol production was observed already in 2.8\%
	            oxygen, only minor differences in the flux distribution were
	            observed, compared to fully aerobic conditions. However, in 1.0\%
	            and 0.5\% oxygen the respiratory rate was severely restricted,
	            resulting in progressively reduced fluxes through the TCA cycle
	            and the direction of major fluxes to the fermentative pathway. A
	            redistribution of fluxes was observed in all branching points of
	            central carbon metabolism. Yet only when oxygen provision was
	            reduced to 0.5\%, was the biomass yield exceeded by the yields of
	            ethanol and CO2. Respirative ATP generation provided 59\% of the
	            ATP demand in fully aerobic conditions and still a substantial 25
	            \% in 0.5\% oxygenation. An extensive redistribution of fluxes
	            was observed in anaerobic conditions compared to all the aerobic
	            conditions. Positive correlation between the transcriptional
	            levels of metabolic enzymes and the corresponding fluxes in the
	            different oxygenation conditions was found only in the
	            respirative pathway. CONCLUSION: 13C-constrained MFA enabled
	            quantitative determination of intracellular fluxes in conditions
	            of different redox challenges without including redox cofactors
	            in metabolite mass balances. A redistribution of fluxes was
	            observed not only for respirative, respiro-fermentative and
	            fermentative metabolisms, but also for cells grown with 2.8\%,
	            1.0\% and 0.5\% oxygen. Although the cellular metabolism was
	            respiro-fermentative in each of these low oxygen conditions, the
	            actual amount of oxygen available resulted in different
	            contributions through respirative and fermentative pathways.},

	            estimation, and systematic error in sloppy models. We show that
	            the approximate nature of mathematical models poses challenges
	            for experimental design in sloppy models. In many models of
	            complex biological processes it is unknown what are the relevant
	            physical mechanisms that must be included to explain system
	            behaviors. As a consequence, models are often overly complex,
	            with many practically unidentifiable parameters. Furthermore,
	            which mechanisms are relevant/irrelevant vary among experiments.
	            By selecting complementary experiments, experimental design may
	            inadvertently make details that were ommitted from the model
	            become relevant. When this occurs, the model will have a large
	            systematic error and fail to give a good fit to the data. We use
	            a simple hyper-model of model error to quantify a model's
	            discrepancy and apply it to two models of complex biological
	            processes (EGFR signaling and DNA repair) with optimally selected
	            experiments. We find that although parameters may be accurately
	            estimated, the discrepancy in the model renders it less
	            predictive than it was in the sloppy regime where systematic
	            error is small. We introduce the concept of a sloppy system-a
	            sequence of models of increasing complexity that become sloppy in
	            the limit of microscopic accuracy. We explore the limits of
	            accurate parameter estimation in sloppy systems and argue that
	            identifying underlying mechanisms controlling system behavior is
	            better approached by considering a hierarchy of models of varying
	            detail rather than focusing on parameter estimation in a single

	abstract = {In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of
	            large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the
	            challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic
	            rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or
	            genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling
	            (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy to address these
	            challenges by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary
	            reaction steps and incorporating all phenotypic observations,
	            upon perturbation, in its model parameterization scheme. Here, we
	            present a kinetic model of Escherichia coli core metabolism that
	            satisfies the fluxomic data for wild-type and seven mutant
	            strains by making use of the EM concepts. This model encompasses
	            138 reactions, 93 metabolites and 60 substrate-level regulatory
	            interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose
	            phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism,
	            anaplerotic reactions and a number of reactions in other parts of
	            the metabolism. Parameterization is performed using a formal
	            optimization approach that minimizes the discrepancies between
	            model predictions and flux measurements. The predicted fluxes by
	            the model are within the uncertainty range of experimental flux
	            data for 78\% of the reactions (with measured fluxes) for both
	            the wild-type and seven mutant strains. The remaining flux
	            predictions are mostly within three standard deviations of
	            reported ranges. Converting the EM-based parameters into a
	            Michaelis–Menten equivalent formalism revealed that 35\% of Km
	            and 77\% of kcat parameters are within uncertainty range of the
	            literature-reported values. The predicted metabolite
	            concentrations by the model are also within uncertainty ranges of
	            metabolomic data for 68\% of the metabolites. A leave-one-out
	            cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance
	            of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located
	            in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be
	            predicted more accurately. The constructed model and the
	            parameterization procedure presented in this study pave the way
	            for the construction of larger-scale kinetic models with more
	            narrowly distributed parameter values as new metabolomic/fluxomic
	            data sets are becoming available for E. coli and other organisms.

	            being able to unravel the interaction of cancer cell metabolism
	            and immune metabolism in therapeutically meaningful ways.
	            Although there are metabolic processes that are seemingly
	            fundamental to both cancer and responding immune cells, metabolic
	            heterogeneity and plasticity may serve to distinguish the two. As
	            such, understanding the differential metabolic requirements of
	            the diverse cells that comprise an immune response to cancer
	            offers an opportunity to selectively regulate immune cell
	            function. Such a nuanced evaluation of cancer and immune
	            metabolism can uncover metabolic vulnerabilities and therapeutic
	            windows upon which to intervene for enhanced immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {The use of cell numbers rather than mass to quantify the size of
	            the biotic phase in animal cell cultures causes several problems.
	            First, the cell size varies with growth conditions, thus yields
	            expressed in terms of cell numbers cannot be used in the normal
	            mass balance sense. Second, experience from microbial systems
	            shows that cell number dynamics lag behind biomass dynamics. This
	            work demonstrates that this lag phenomenon also occurs in animal
	            cell culture. Both the lag phenomenon and the variation in cell
	            size are explained using a simple model of the cell cycle. The
	            basis for the model is that onset of DNA synthesis requires
	            accumulation of G1 cyclins to a prescribed level. This
	            requirement is translated into a requirement for a cell to reach
	            a critical size before commencement of DNA synthesis. A slower
	            growing cell will spend more time in G1 before reaching the
	            critical mass. In contrast, the period between onset of DNA
	            synthesis and mitosis, τ(B), is fixed. The two parameters in the
	            model, the critical size and τ(B), were determined from eight
	            steady-state measurements of mean cell size in a continuous
	            hybridoma culture. Using these parameters, it was possible to
	            predict with reasonable accuracy the transient behavior in a
	            separate shift- up culture, i.e., a culture where cells were
	            transferred from a lean environment to a rich environment. The

	abstract = {Lactate is one of the key waste metabolites of mammalian cell
	            culture. High lactate levels are caused by high aerobic
	            glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, and are usually
	            associated with adverse culture performance. Therefore, reducing
	            lactate accumulation has been an ongoing challenge in the cell
	            culture development to improve growth, productivity, and process
	            robustness. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a
	            crucial role for the fate of pyruvate, as it converts pyruvate to
	            acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The PDC activity can be
	            indirectly increased by inhibiting the PDC inhibitor, pyruvate
	            dehydrogenase kinase, using dichloroacetate (DCA), resulting in
	            less pyruvate being available for lactate formation. Here,
	            Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultivated either with 5 mM DCA
	            or without DCA in various batch and fed-batch bioreactor
	            processes. In all cultures, DCA increased peak viable cell
	            density (VCD), culture length and final antibody titer. The
	            strongest effect was observed in a fed batch with media and
	            glucose feeding in which peak VCD was increased by more than 50\%
	            , culture length was extended by more than 3 days, and the final
	            antibody titer increased by more than twofold. In cultures with
	            DCA, lactate production and glucose consumption during
	            exponential growth were on average reduced by approximately 40\%
	            and 35\%, respectively. Metabolic flux analysis showed reduced
	            glycolytic fluxes, whereas fluxes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
	            cycle were not affected, suggesting that cultures with DCA use
	            glucose more efficiently. In a proteomics analysis, only few
	            proteins were identified as being differentially expressed,
	            indicating that DCA acts on a posttranslational level. Antibody
	            quality in terms of aggregation, charge variant, and
	            glycosylation pattern was unaffected. Subsequent bioreactor
	            experiments with sodium lactate and sodium chloride feeding
	            indicated that lower osmolality, rather than lower lactate
	            concentration itself, improved culture performance in DCA
	            cultures. In conclusion, the addition of DCA to the cell culture
	            improved culture performance and increased antibody titers

	            growth inhibitory in nature. A major fraction of these inhibitory
	            metabolites are byproducts or intermediates of amino acid

	            curtail the production of corresponding inhibitory byproducts
	            resulting in enhanced growth and productivities in CHO fed-batch
	            cultures (Mulukutla et al., 2017). In the current study,
	            metabolic engineering of CHO cells was undertaken in order to
	            reduce the biosynthesis of these novel growth inhibitors.
	            Phenylalanine-tyrosine (Phe-Tyr) and branched chain amino acid
	            (BCAA) pathways were engineered as part of this effort. Four
	            genes that encode enzymes in the Phe-Tyr pathway, which were

	            byproducts from Phe-Tyr pathway including 3-phenyllactate and
	            4-hydroxyphenyllactate. In case of BCAA catabolic pathway,

	            Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we cultivated CHO cells using
	            a perfusion bioreactor. Cells were cultivated at 37 degrees C
	            until viable cell concentration reached 1 x 10(7) cells/mL, and
	            then culture temperature was shifted to 25 degrees C, 28 degrees
	            C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C (control),
	            respectively. Lowering culture temperature suppressed cell growth
	            but was beneficial to maintain high cell viability for a longer
	            period. In a control culture at 37 degrees C, cell viability
	            gradually decreased and fell below 80\% on day 18 while it
	            remained over 90\% throughout the culture at low culture
	            temperature. The cumulative EPO production and specific EPO
	            productivity, q(EPO), increased at low culture temperature and
	            were the highest at 32 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively.
	            Interestingly, the cumulative EPO production at culture
	            temperature below 32 degrees C was not as high as the cumulative
	            EPO production at 32 degrees C although the q(EPO) at culture
	            temperature below 32 degrees C was comparable or even higher than
	            the q(EPO) at 32 degrees C. This implies that the beneficial
	            effect of lowering culture temperature below 32 degrees C on
	            q(EPO) is outweighed by its detrimental effect on the integral of
	            viable cells. The glycosylation of EPO was evaluated by
	            isoelectric focusing, normal phase HPLC and anion exchange
	            chromatography analyses. The quality of EPO at 32 degrees C in
	            regard to acidic isoforms, antennary structures and sialylated
	            N-linked glycans was comparable to that at 37 degrees C. However,
	            at culture temperatures below 32 degrees C, the proportions of
	            acidic isoforms, tetra-antennary structures and tetra-sialylated
	            N-linked glycans were further reduced, suggesting that lowering
	            culture temperature below 32 degrees C negatively affect the
	            quality of EPO. Thus, taken together, cell culture at 32 degrees
	            C turned out to be the most satisfactory since it showed the
	            highest cumulative EPO production, and moreover, EPO quality at
	            32 degrees C was not deteriorated as obtained at 37 degrees C.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mammalian cells like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
	            cells are routinely used for production of recombinant
	            therapeutic proteins. Cells require a continuous supply of energy
	            and nutrients to sustain high cell densities whilst expressing
	            high titres of recombinant proteins. Cultured mammalian cells are
	            primarily dependent on glucose and glutamine metabolism for
	            energy production. OBJECTIVES: The TCA cycle is the main source
	            of energy production and its continuous flow is essential for
	            cell survival. Modulated regulation of TCA cycle can affect ATP
	            production and influence CHO cell productivity. METHODS: To
	            determine the key metabolic reactions of the cycle associated
	            with cell growth in CHO cells, we transiently silenced each gene
	            of the TCA cycle using RNAi. RESULTS: Silencing of at least four
	            TCA cycle genes was detrimental to CHO cell growth. With an
	            exception of mitochondrial aconitase (or Aco2), all other genes
	            were associated with ATP production reactions of the TCA cycle
	            and their resulting substrates can be supplied by other
	            anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions. This study is the first
	            of its kind to have established key role of aconitase gene in CHO
	            cells. We further investigated the temporal effects of aconitase
	            silencing on energy production, CHO cell metabolism, oxidative
	            stress and recombinant protein production. CONCLUSION: Transient
	            silencing of mitochondrial aconitase inhibited cell growth,
	            reduced ATP production, increased production of reactive oxygen
	            species and reduced cell specific productivity of a recombinant
	            CHO cell line by at least twofold.},

	            However, relatively little is known about the metabolism of CHO
	            cells in cell culture. In this work, metabolism of CHO cells was
	            studied at the growth phase and early stationary phase using
	            isotopic tracers and mass spectrometry. CHO cells were grown in
	            fed-batch culture over a period of six days. On days 2 and 4, [1,
	            2-(13)C] glucose was introduced and the labeling of intracellular
	            metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
	            (GC-MS) at 6, 12 and 24h following the introduction of tracer.
	            Intracellular metabolic fluxes were quantified from measured
	            extracellular rates and (13)C-labeling dynamics of intracellular
	            metabolites using non-stationary (13)C-metabolic flux analysis
	            ((13)C-MFA). The flux results revealed significant rewiring of
	            intracellular metabolic fluxes in the transition from growth to
	            non-growth, including changes in energy metabolism, redox
	            metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis.
	            At the exponential phase, CHO cell metabolism was characterized
	            by a high flux of glycolysis from glucose to lactate, anaplerosis
	            from pyruvate to oxaloacetate and from glutamate to
	            α-ketoglutarate, and cataplerosis though malic enzyme. At the
	            stationary phase, the flux map was characterized by a reduced
	            flux of glycolysis, net lactate uptake, oxidative pentose
	            phosphate pathway flux, and reduced rate of anaplerosis. The
	            fluxes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and TCA cycle were similar at
	            the exponential and stationary phase. The results presented here
	            provide a solid foundation for future studies of CHO cell

	abstract = {Glucose is an essential substrate for lactose synthesis and an
	            important energy source in milk production. Glucose uptake in the
	            mammary gland, therefore, plays a critical role in milk
	            synthesis. Facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT) mediate
	            glucose uptake in the mammary gland. Glucose transporter 1
	            (GLUT1) is the major facilitative glucose transporter expressed
	            in the bovine mammary gland and has been shown to localize to the
	            basolateral membrane of mammary epithelial cells. Glucose
	            transporter 1 is, therefore, thought to play a major role in
	            glucose uptake during lactation. The objective of this study was
	            to determine the transport kinetic properties and substrate
	            specificity of bovine GLUT1 using the Xenopus oocyte model.
	            Bovine GLUT1 (bGLUT1) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by
	            microinjection of in vitro transcribed cRNA and was found to be
	            localized to the plasma membrane, which resulted in increased
	            glucose uptake. This bGLUT1-mediated glucose uptake was
	            dramatically inhibited by specific facilitative glucose transport
	            inhibitors, cytochalasin B, and phloretin. Kinetic analysis of
	            bovine and human GLUT1 was conducted under zero-trans conditions
	            using radio-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose and the principles of
	            Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Bovine GLUT1 exhibited a Michaelis
	            constant (K(m)) of 9.8 ± 3.0mM for 2-deoxy-d-glucose, similar to
	            11.7 ± 3.7 mM for human GLUT1. Transport by bGLUT1 was inhibited
	            by mannose and galactose, but not fructose, indicating that
	            bGLUT1 may also be able to transport mannose and galactose. Our
	            data provides functional insight into the transport properties of
	            bGLUT1 in taking up glucose across mammary epithelial cells for
	            milk synthesis. Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science

	abstract = {The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a fundamental component
	            of cellular metabolism. It provides precursors for the
	            biosynthesis of nucleotides and contributes to the production of
	            reducing power in the form of NADPH. It has been hypothesized
	            that mammalian cells may contain a hidden reaction in PPP
	            catalyzed by transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) that is closely
	            related to the classical transketolase enzyme; however, until now
	            there has been no direct experimental evidence for this reaction.
	            In this work, we have applied state-of-the-art techniques in
	            (13)C metabolic flux analysis ((13)C-MFA) based on parallel
	            labeling experiments and integrated flux fitting to estimate the
	            TKTL1 flux in CHO cells. We identified a set of three parallel
	            labeling experiments with [1-(13)C]glucose+[4,5,6-(13)C]glucose,
	            [2-(13)C]glucose+[4,5,6-(13)C]glucose, and [3-(13)C]glucose+[4,5,
	            6-(13)C]glucose and developed a new method to measure
	            (13)C-labeling of fructose 6-phosphate by GC-MS that allows
	            intuitive interpretation of mass isotopomer distributions to
	            determine key fluxes in the model, including glycolysis,
	            oxidative PPP, non-oxidative PPP, and the TKTL1 flux. Using these
	            tracers we detected a significant TKTL1 flux in CHO cells at the
	            stationary phase. The flux results suggest that the main function
	            of oxidative PPP in CHO cells at the stationary phase is to fuel
	            the TKTL1 reaction. Overall, this study demonstrates for the
	            first time that carbon atoms can be lost in the PPP, by means
	            other than the oxidative PPP, and that this loss of carbon atoms
	            is consistent with the hypothesized TKTL1 reaction in mammalian

	            accumulation of lactate to high levels. In such fed-batch
	            cultures, sometimes a metabolic shift from a state of high

	            to produce lactate. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption has
	            been correlated to the productivity of the process. Cultures that
	            exhibited the metabolic shift to lactate consumption had higher

	            the metabolic shift to lactate consumption state (or low lactate

	            the glycolysis of proliferating cells can exhibit bistability
	            with well-segregated high flux and low flux states. Low lactate

	            The transition from the high flux state to the low flux state can
	            only occur in certain regions of the steady state topology, and
	            therefore the metabolic fate of the cells depends on their
	            metabolic trajectory encountering the region that allows such a
	            metabolic state switch. Insights from such switch behavior

	            metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. At the growth phase, de
	            novo fatty acid biosynthesis correlated well with the lipid
	            requirements for cell growth. However, surprisingly, at the
	            non-growth phase the fatty acid biosynthesis flux remained high
	            even though no new lipids were needed for cell growth.
	            Additionally, we identified a discrepancy in the estimated TCA
	            cycle flux obtained using traditional stoichiometric flux
	            balancing and (13)C-metabolic flux analysis. Our results

	abstract = {The membranes of mammalian cells contain hundreds of different
	            phospholipid species, a variety of glycolipids and cholesterol.
	            While the reasons for such compositional diversity are not well
	            established, they probably relate to a multitude of
	            membrane-associated functions each of which sets specific
	            requirements for the chemical and physical properties of
	            membranes. The lipid composition of membranes must therefore be
	            accurately controlled. The maintenance of phospholipid
	            homeostasis in a mammalian cell is a daunting task due to
	            presence of many phospholipid (and other lipid) classes and
	            hundreds of different molecular species. In addition, the
	            phospholipid composition of the cellular membranes depends on
	            several different phenomena including biosynthesis, remodelling,
	            degradation and interorganelle trafficking. Accordingly, it is
	            not surprising that phospholipid homeostasis in mammalian cells
	            is poorly understood. Particularly little is known about the
	            regulation and coordination of processes contributing to
	            homeostasis. Nevertheless, it has become obvious that selective
	            degradation plays a major role, albeit the enzymes involved
	            remain to be discovered. Beside the complexity of the phenomenon,
	            methodological limitations have hampered the progress in this
	            field. Here, we review the key features of the processes
	            contributing to phospholipid homeostasis in mammalian cells, with
	            a particular emphasis on the regulation and coordination of
	            biosynthesis and degradation. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

	            penicillin and insulin. These same microorganismscan potentially
	            be used to produce a diverse range of other molecules and
	            contribute to a more sustainable future by reducing our
	            dependency on oil. Producing a givenmolecule at a yield high
	            enough to be commercially viable, however, usually requires cell
	            metabolism to be modified extensively. Traditionally, these
	            modifications havebeen introduced through random mutagenesis and
	            selection, which has been gradually complemented by more targeted
	            genetic engineering approaches that rely more andmore also on
	            computational models of cell metabolism for target selection. Two
	            main types of models can be used here, stoichiometric models or
	            kinetic models. The formerare easily built at genome-scale and
	            assume the cell to be in a steady-state, giving information only
	            about the reactions\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\} fluxes,
	            while the latter take into account enzymedynamics which makes it
	            possible to model substrate-level enzyme regulation and get
	            information about metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes
	            over time, althoughat the cost of introducing more parameters.
	            Kinetic models have been plagued by the lack of kinetic data.The
	            focus of this thesis are kinetic models of cell metabolism. In
	            this work we start by developing a software package to create a
	            model ensemble for individualenzymes in metabolism, where we
	            decompose each reaction into elementary steps, using mass action
	            kinetics to model each step. The resulting rate constants are
	            thenfitted to kinetic data (kcat, Km, Ki, etc.). We then use the
	            package as the basis to build a system-level kinetic model. To do
	            so, we take two different approaches, andin both we drop the
	            assumption that χfree ≈ χtot , i.e. that the total concentration
	            of metabolite in the cell is approximately the same as the free
	            concentration. In bothapproaches preliminary results show that
	            the fraction of bound metabolite in the cell is not negligible,
	            with some metabolites having an enzyme-bound concentrationup to
	            40\%. Next, we address the issue of kinetic data scarcity by
	            using molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the difference
	            in binding energies, ΔΔG, between substrate(s) and a given enzyme
	            and product(s) and the same enzyme for a chosen reaction. Here,
	            we show that these in silico determined ΔΔG significantly reduce
	            theamount of rate constants combinations allowed in each model
	            ensemble. Finally, we combine a kinetic model of glycolysis in
	            Saccharomyces cerevisiae with time-resolvedNMR experiments to
	            study the cellular response to a glucose pulse, and show the
	            model simulations to be in agreement with the experimental
	            results.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Metabolic flux balance analysis (FBA) is a standard
	            tool in analyzing metabolic reaction rates compatible with
	            measurements, steady-state and the metabolic reaction network
	            stoichiometry. Flux analysis methods commonly place model
	            assumptions on fluxes due to the convenience of formulating the
	            problem as a linear programing model, while many methods do not
	            consider the inherent uncertainty in flux estimates. RESULTS: We
	            introduce a novel paradigm of Bayesian metabolic flux analysis
	            that models the reactions of the whole genome-scale cellular
	            system in probabilistic terms, and can infer the full flux vector
	            distribution of genome-scale metabolic systems based on exchange
	            and intracellular (e.g. 13C) flux measurements, steady-state
	            assumptions, and objective function assumptions. The Bayesian
	            model couples all fluxes jointly together in a simple truncated
	            multivariate posterior distribution, which reveals informative
	            flux couplings. Our model is a plug-in replacement to
	            conventional metabolic balance methods, such as FBA. Our
	            experiments indicate that we can characterize the genome-scale
	            flux covariances, reveal flux couplings, and determine more
	            intracellular unobserved fluxes in Clostridium acetobutylicum
	            from 13C data than flux variability analysis. AVAILABILITY AND

	            quantitative phenotype prediction. The mechanistic
	            characterization of enzyme catalyzed reactions allows for tracing

	            In this study, we develop a two-step computational pipeline for
	            the rapid parameterization of kinetic models of metabolic
	            networks using a curated metabolic model and available
	            13C-labeling distributions under multiple genetic and

	            coli containing 74 reactions and 61 metabolites using
	            13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA). Here, fluxes corresponding
	            to the mid-exponential growth phase are elucidated for seven
	            single gene deletion mutants from upper glycolysis, pentose
	            phosphate pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The computed
	            flux ranges are then used to parameterize the same (i.e.,
	            k-ecoli74) core kinetic model for E. coli with 55 substrate-level
	            regulations using the newly developed K-FIT parameterization
	            algorithm. The K-FIT algorithm employs a combination of equation
	            decomposition and iterative solution techniques to evaluate
	            steady-state fluxes in response to genetic perturbations.
	            k-ecoli74 predicted 86\% of flux values for strains used during
	            fitting within a single standard deviation of 13C-MFA estimated
	            values. By performing both tasks using the same network, errors

	            avoided, allowing for seamless integration of data with model
	            building. Product yield predictions and comparison with
	            previously developed kinetic models indicate shifts in flux

	abstract = {In this paper we generalize the Linear Chain Trick (LCT; aka the
	            Gamma Chain Trick) to help provide modelers more flexibility to
	            incorporate appropriate dwell time assumptions into mean field
	            ODEs, and help clarify connections between individual-level
	            stochastic model assumptions and the structure of corresponding
	            mean field ODEs. The LCT is a technique used to construct mean
	            field ODE models from continuous-time stochastic state transition
	            models where the time an individual spends in a given state (i.e.
	            , the dwell time) is Erlang distributed (i.e., gamma distributed
	            with integer shape parameter). Despite the LCT's widespread use,
	            we lack general theory to facilitate the easy application of this
	            technique, especially for complex models. Modelers must therefore
	            choose between constructing ODE models using heuristics with
	            oversimplified dwell time assumptions, using time consuming
	            derivations from first principles, or to instead use non-ODE
	            models (like integro-differential or delay differential
	            equations) which can be cumbersome to derive and analyze. Here,

	            efficiently construct ODE models using the LCT or related

	abstract = {Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is found in all organisms and
	            catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of L-glutamate to
	            2-oxoglutarate. Unlike GDH from bacteria, mammalian GDH exhibits
	            negative cooperativity with respect to coenzyme, activation by
	            ADP, and inhibition by GTP. Presented here are the structures of
	            apo bovine GDH, bovine GDH complexed with ADP, and the R463A
	            mutant form of human GDH (huGDH) that is insensitive to ADP
	            activation. In the absence of active site ligands, the catalytic
	            cleft is in the open conformation, and the hexamers form long
	            polymers in the crystal cell with more interactions than found in
	            the abortive complex crystals. This is consistent with the fact
	            that ADP promotes aggregation in solution. ADP is shown to bind
	            to the second, inhibitory, NADH site yet causes activation. The
	            beta-phosphates of the bound ADP interact with R459 (R463 in
	            huGDH) on the pivot helix. The structure of the ADP-resistant,
	            R463A mutant of human GDH is identical to native GDH with the
	            exception of the truncated side chain on the pivot helix.
	            Together, these results strongly suggest that ADP activates by
	            facilitating the opening of the catalytic cleft. From alignment
	            of GDH from various sources, it is likely that the antenna
	            evolved in the protista prior to the formation of purine
	            regulatory sites. This suggests that there was some selective
	            advantage of the antenna itself and that animals evolved new
	            functions for GDH through the addition of allosteric regulation.},

	            ATP. In mammals, the activity eliminates cytotoxic ammonia, at
	            the same time converting neurotoxic glutamate to harmless
	            glutamine; there are a number of links between changes in GS
	            activity and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's
	            disease. In plants, because of its importance in the assimilation
	            and re-assimilation of ammonia, the enzyme is a target of some
	            herbicides. GS is also a central component of bacterial nitrogen
	            metabolism and a potential drug target. Previous studies had
	            investigated the structures of bacterial and plant GSs. In the
	            present publication, we report the first structures of mammalian
	            GSs. The apo form of the canine enzyme was solved by molecular
	            replacement and refined at a resolution of 3 A. Two structures of
	            human glutamine synthetase represent complexes with: a) phosphate
	            , ADP, and manganese, and b) a phosphorylated form of the
	            inhibitor methionine sulfoximine, ADP and manganese; these
	            structures were refined to resolutions of 2.05 A and 2.6 A,
	            respectively. Loop movements near the active site generate more
	            closed forms of the eukaryotic enzymes when substrates are bound;
	            the largest changes are associated with the binding of the
	            nucleotide. Comparisons with earlier structures provide a basis
	            for the design of drugs that are specifically directed at either
	            human or bacterial enzymes. The site of binding the amino acid
	            substrate is highly conserved in bacterial and eukaryotic GSs,
	            whereas the nucleotide binding site varies to a much larger
	            degree. Thus, the latter site offers the best target for specific
	            drug design. Differences between mammalian and plant enzymes are
	            much more subtle, suggesting that herbicides targeting GS must be
	            designed with caution.},

	abstract = {Malic enzymes are widely distributed in nature, and have
	            important biological functions. They catalyze the oxidative
	            decarboxylation of malate to produce pyruvate and CO(2) in the
	            presence of divalent cations (Mg(2+), Mn(2+)). Most malic enzymes
	            have a clear selectivity for the dinucleotide cofactor, being
	            able to use either NAD(+) or NADP(+), but not both. Structural
	            studies of the human mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent malic enzyme
	            established that malic enzymes belong to a new class of oxidative
	            decarboxylases. Here we report the crystal structure of the
	            pigeon cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme, in a closed form
	            , in a quaternary complex with NADP(+), Mn(2+), and oxalate. This
	            represents the first structural information on an

	            , there are large differences in several regions of the pigeon
	            enzyme structure compared to the human enzyme. One region of such
	            differences is at the binding site for the 2'-phosphate group of
	            the NADP(+) cofactor, which helps define the cofactor selectivity
	            of the enzymes. Specifically, the structural information suggests
	            Lys362 may have an important role in the NADP(+) selectivity of
	            the pigeon enzyme, confirming our earlier kinetic observations on
	            the K362A mutant. Our structural studies also revealed
	            differences in the organization of the tetramer between the
	            pigeon and the human enzymes, although the pigeon enzyme still
	            obeys 222 symmetry.},

	            Krämer, R. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 937, 122-126).
	            Bireactant initial velocity analyses of the counterexchange
	            reaction were carried out varying substrate concentrations both
	            in the internal and the external compartment. The kinetic
	            patterns obtained were inconsistent with a pong-pong mechanism;
	            rather they demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex as a
	            consequence of sequential binding of one internal and one
	            external substrate molecule to the carrier. Studies on transport
	            activity in the presence of aspartate and glutamate in the same
	            compartment (formally treated as substrate inhibition) clearly
	            indicated that during exchange only one form of the carrier at
	            either membrane surface exposes its binding sites, for which the
	            two different substrates compete. In the deenergized state (pH
	            6.5) both substrates were translocated at about the same rate.
	            Aspartate/glutamate antiport became asymmetric if a membrane
	            potential was imposed, due to the electrogenic nature of the
	            heteroexchange resulting from proton cotransport together with
	            glutamate. Investigation of the electrical properties of

	            transmembrane symmetry with respect to the (negative) charge,
	            which again only is conceivable assuming a ternary complex. Thus,
	            an antiport model is outlined that shows the functional complex
	            of the carrier with two substrate molecules bound, one at either
	            side of the membrane. The conformational change associated with
	            the transition of both substrate molecules across the membrane
	            then occurs in a single step. Furthermore the model implicates a
	            distinct proton binding site, which is derived from the different
	            influence of H+ concentration observed on transport affinity and
	            transport velocity, respectively, when glutamate is used as a

	            enzyme that catalyses the transamination reaction: L-aspartate +
	            2-oxoglutarate----oxaloacetate + L-glutamate. The enzyme shuttles
	            between its pyridoxal and pyridoxamine forms in a
	            double-displacement process. This paper proposes a mechanism of
	            action that delineates the dynamic role of the protein moiety of
	            this enzyme. It is based on crystallographically determined
	            spatial structures (at 2.8 A resolution) of the mitochondrial
	            isoenzyme in its unliganded forms and in complexes with substrate
	            analogues, as well as on model building studies. The enzyme is
	            composed of two identical subunits, which consist of two domains.
	            The coenzyme is bound to the larger domain and is situated in a
	            pocket near the subunit interface. The proximal and distal
	            carboxylate group of dicarboxylic substrates are bound to Arg386
	            and Arg292 , respectively, the latter residue belonging to the
	            adjacent subunit. These interactions largely determine the
	            substrate specificity of the enzyme. They not only position the
	            substrate efficient catalysis but also bring about a bulk
	            movement of the small domain that closes the active site crevice
	            and moves Arg386 about 3 A closer to the coenzyme. The
	            replacement of the epsilon-amino group of Lys258 by the
	            alpha-amino group of the substrate in the aldimine bond to
	            pyridoxal phosphate is accompanied by a tilting of the coenzyme
	            by approximately 30 degrees. The released epsilon-amino group of
	            Lys258 serves as a proton acceptor/donor in the 1,3- prototropic
	            shift producing the ketimine intermediate. At this stage, or
	            after hydrolysis of the ketimine bond, the coenzyme rotates back
	            to an orientation between that in the "external" aldimine
	            intermediate and that in the pyridoxal form. Throughout this
	            process, the protonated pyridine nitrogen atom maintains a

	            Formation of this ternary complex enables low levels of the
	            alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, in the presence of the
	            aminotransferase, to reverse inhibition of malate oxidation by
	            glutamate. Thus, glutamate can react with the aminotransferase in
	            this complex without glutamate inhibiting production of
	            oxalacetate by the malate dehydrogenase in the complex. The
	            conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate could also be
	            facilitated because in the trienzyme complex, oxalacetate might
	            be directly transferred from malate dehydrogenase to the
	            aminotransferase. In addition, association of malate
	            dehydrogenase with these other two enzymes enhances malate
	            dehydrogenase activity due to a marked decrease in the Km of
	            malate. The potential ability of the aminotransferase to transfer
	            directly alpha-ketoglutarate to the alpha-ketoglutarate
	            dehydrogenase complex in this multienzyme system plus the ability
	            of succinyl-CoA, a product of this transfer, to inhibit citrate
	            synthase could play a role in preventing alpha-ketoglutarate and
	            citrate from accumulating in high levels. This would maintain the
	            catalytic activity of the multienzyme system because
	            alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate allosterically inhibit malate
	            dehydrogenase and dissociate this enzyme from the multienzyme
	            system. In addition, citrate also competitively inhibits
	            fumarase. Consequently, when the levels of alpha-ketoglutarate
	            and citrate are high and the multienzyme system is not required
	            to convert glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate, it is inactive.
	            However, control by citrate would be expected to be absent in
	            rapidly dividing tumors which characteristically have low
	            mitochondrial levels of citrate.},

	            observed in both isotope exchange studies and initial velocity
	            studies has not yet been identified. In the present study, we
	            develop an 11-state kinetic model of the enzyme based on the
	            current consensus on its catalytic mechanism and design a series
	            of experiments to estimate the model parameters and identify the

	            dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC), a key regulatory point of
	            tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, plays vital roles in multiple
	            pathways of energy metabolism and biosynthesis. The catalytic
	            mechanism and allosteric regulation of this large enzyme complex
	            are not fully understood. Here computer simulation is used to
	            test possible catalytic mechanisms and mechanisms of allosteric
	            regulation of the enzyme by nucleotides (ATP, ADP), pH, and metal
	            ion cofactors (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)). RESULTS: A model was developed
	            based on an ordered ter-ter enzyme kinetic mechanism combined
	            with con-formational changes that involve rotation of one lipoic
	            acid between three catalytic sites inside the enzyme complex. The
	            model was parameterized using a large number of kinetic data sets
	            on the activity of OGDHC, and validated by comparison of model
	            predictions to independent data. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model
	            suggests a hybrid rapid-equilibrium ping-pong random mechanism
	            for the kinetics of OGDHC, consistent with previously reported
	            mechanisms, and accurately describes the experimentally observed

	            thermophilus catalyzes the reduction of oxalosuccinate, which
	            corresponds to the second step of the reductive carboxylation of
	            2-oxoglutarate in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. In this
	            study, the oxidation reaction catalyzed by H. thermophilus ICDH
	            was kinetically analyzed. As a result, a rapid equilibrium
	            random-order mechanism was suggested. The affinities of both
	            substrates (isocitrate and NAD+) toward the enzyme were extremely
	            low compared to other known ICDHs. The binding activities of
	            isocitrate and NAD+ were not independent; rather, the binding of
	            one substrate considerably promoted the binding of the other. A
	            product inhibition assay demonstrated that NADH is a potent
	            inhibitor, although 2-oxoglutarate did not exhibit an inhibitory
	            effect. Further chromatographic analysis demonstrated that
	            oxalosuccinate, rather than 2-oxoglutarate, is the reaction
	            product. Thus, it was shown that H. thermophilus ICDH is a
	            nondecarboxylating ICDH that catalyzes the conversion between
	            isocitrate and oxalosuccinate by oxidation and reduction. This
	            nondecarboxylating ICDH is distinct from well-known
	            decarboxylating ICDHs and should be categorized as a new enzyme.
	            Oxalosuccinate-reducing enzyme may be the ancestral form of ICDH,
	            which evolved to the extant isocitrate oxidative decarboxylating
	            enzyme by acquiring higher substrate affinities.},

	            been possible because the enzyme turns over and selects enzyme
	            with isocitrate bound into the crystal lattice. Therefore we have
	            analyzed crystal structures of the enzyme complexed with
	            inhibitor analogs of these two substrates. The structure with
	            nitrocitrate bound provides a model for citrate binding. The
	            structure with trans-aconitate bound provides a model for
	            cis-aconitate binding in two ways: Fe4 of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is
	            five-coordinate and the carbon at the C beta position is
	            trigonal. These results allow the model for the reaction
	            mechanism to be extended to all three natural substrates of
	            aconitase. The results support a model in which citrate and
	            isocitrate form similar chelate structures related by 180 degrees
	            rotation about the C alpha-C beta bond while the intermediate
	            cis-aconitate binds in either of two ways (citrate mode or
	            isocitrate mode). In both inhibitor complexes a H2O molecule is
	            also bound to Fe4. In the structure with nitrocitrate bound,

	            their stability to transport L-lactate by measuring either the
	            distribution of [14C]lactate or concomitant H+ ion movements. The
	            movement of lactate was dependent on the pH difference across the
	            cell membrane and was electroneutral, as evidenced by an observed
	            1:1 antiport for OH- ions or 1:1 symport with H+ ions. 2. Kinetic
	            experiments showed that lactate transport was saturable, with an
	            apparent Km of approx. 4.68 mM and a Vmax. as high as 680
	            nmol/min per mg of protein at pH 6.2 and 37 degrees C. 3. Lactate
	            transport exhibited a high temperature dependence (activation
	            energy = 139 kJ/mol). 4. Lactate transport was inhibited
	            competitively by (a) a variety of other substituted
	            monocarboxylic acids (e.g. pyruvate, Ki = 6.3 mM), which were
	            themselves transported, (b) the non-transportable analogues
	            alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (Ki = 0.5 mM),
	            alpha-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamate (Ki = 2mM) and
	            DL-p-hydroxyphenyl-lactate (Ki = 3.6 mM) and (c) the thiol-group
	            reagent mersalyl (Ki = 125 muM). 5. Transport of simple
	            monocarboxylic acids, including acetate and propionate, was
	            insensitive to these inhibitors; they presumably cross the
	            membrane by means of a different mechanism. 6. Experiments using
	            saturating amounts of mersalyl as an "inhibitor stop" allowed
	            measurements of the initial rates of net influx and of net efflux
	            of [14C]lactate. Influx and efflux of lactate were judged to be
	            symmetrical reactions in that they exhibited similar
	            concentration dependence. 7. It is concluded that lactate
	            transport in Ehrlich ascites-tumour cells is mediated by a
	            carrier capable of transporting a number of other substituted

	            with SO4(2-) ions alone and with ATP, Cd2+ and SO4(2-) ions
	            respectively. The AMP moiety of ATP binds at the ATP-binding site
	            , and a Cd2+ ion binds at the active site and in a position to
	            interact with the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP. A SO4(2-)
	            ion, an analogue of the activator phosphate, was found to bind at
	            both the R5P-binding site and the allosteric site defined

	            dimer interface between the ATP-binding site and the allosteric
	            site. Binding of this SO4(2-) stabilizes the conformation of the

	            that structural stabilization at the active site caused by

	            ordered. The pathway through the enzyme--6-phosphogluconate

	            Pre-steady-state studies of the oxidative decarboxylation

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
	            (NADP)-dependent oxidative decarboxylase, 6-phosphogluconate
	            dehydrogenase, is a major source of reduced coenzyme for
	            synthesis. Enzymes later in the pentose phosphate pathway convert
	            the reaction product, ribulose 5-phosphate, to ribose
	            5-phosphate. Crystallographic study of complexes with coenzyme
	            and substrate explain the NADP dependence which determines the
	            enzyme's metabolic role and support the proposed general
	            base-general acid mechanism. RESULTS: The refined structures of
	            binary coenzyme/analogue complexes show that Arg33 is ordered by
	            binding the 2'-phosphate, and provides one face of the adenine
	            site. The nicotinamide, while less tightly bound, is more
	            extended when reduced than when oxidized. All substrate binding
	            residues are conserved; the 3-hydroxyl of 6-phosphogluconate is
	            hydrogen bonded to N zeta of Lys183 and the 3-hydrogen points
	            towards the oxidized nicotinamide. The 6-phosphate replaces a
	            tightly bound sulphate in the apo-enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: NADP
	            specificity is achieved primarily by Arg33 which binds the
	            2'-phosphate but, in its absence, obscures the adenine pocket.
	            The bound oxidized nicotinamide is syn; hydride transfer from
	            bound substrate to the nicotinamide si- face is achieved with a
	            small movement of the nicotinamide nucleotide. Lys183 may act as
	            general base. A water bound to Gly130 in the coenzyme domain is
	            the most likely acid required in decarboxylation. The
	            dihydronicotinamide ring of NADPH competes for ligands with the
	            1-carboxyl of 6-phosphogluconate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyses
	            the first committed step in the pentose phosphate pathway; the
	            generation of NADPH by this enzyme is essential for protection
	            against oxidative stress. The human enzyme is in a dimer{
	            \textless} --{\textgreater}tetramer equilibrium and its stability
	            is dependent on NADP(+) concentration. G6PD deficiency results
	            from many different point mutations in the X-linked gene encoding
	            G6PD and is the most common human enzymopathy. Severe deficiency
	            causes chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia; the usual
	            symptoms are neonatal jaundice, favism and haemolytic anaemia.
	            RESULTS: We have determined the first crystal structure of a
	            human G6PD (the mutant Canton, Arg459--{\textgreater}Leu) at 3 A
	            resolution. The tetramer is a dimer of dimers. Despite very
	            similar dimer topology, there are two major differences from G6PD
	            of Leuconostoc mesenteroides: a structural NADP(+) molecule,
	            close to the dimer interface but integral to the subunit, is
	            visible in all subunits of the human enzyme; and an intrasubunit
	            disulphide bond tethers the otherwise disordered N-terminal
	            segment. The few dimer-dimer contacts making the tetramer are
	            charge-charge interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of
	            NADP(+) for stability is explained by the structural NADP(+) site
	            , which is not conserved in prokaryotes. The structure shows that
	            point mutations causing severe deficiency predominate close to
	            the structural NADP(+) and the dimer interface, primarily
	            affecting the stability of the molecule. They also indicate that
	            a stable dimer is essential to retain activity in vivo. As there
	            is an absolute requirement for some G6PD activity, residues
	            essential for coenzyme or substrate binding are rarely modified.},

	            dependence of the weight-average sedimentation coefficient was

	            association and equilibrium constants characterizing each

	            sedimentation data. The simplest mode of association for the PFK
	            system is M in equilibrium M2 equilibrium M4 in equilibrium M16.
	            Ligands and temperature would perturb the various equilibrium
	            constants without altering the mode of association. The apparent
	            equilibrium constants for the formation of tetramer, K4app, are
	            increased in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP and 1.0 mM fructose
	            6-phosphate. The value of the sedimentation coefficient for the
	            tetramer, S4 degrees, that would best fit the data is 12.4 S
	            instead of 13.5 S determined in the absence of substrates, thus
	            implying a structural change in the tetramer induced by
	            substrates. Only an insignificant amount of dimer is present
	            under the experimental conditions. The presence of activators,
	            ADP or phosphate, enhances the formation of tetramers, and S4

	            tetramer involves the binding of two additional molecules of ADP
	            per monomer. Similar analysis results in a conclusion that the

	            fully active homotetramer to a quite inactive dimer. There are
	            evidences that some positive and negative modulators of PFK, such
	            as ADP and citrate, may interfere with the enzyme oligomeric
	            structure shifting the tetramer-dimer equilibrium towards
	            opposite orientations, where the negative modulators favor the
	            dissociation of tetramers into dimers and vice versa. PFK is
	            allosterically inhibited by ATP at its physiological range of
	            concentration, an effect counteracted by fructose-2,
	            6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP). However, the structural molecular
	            mechanism by which ATP and F2,6BP regulate PFK is hitherto
	            demonstrated. The present paper aimed at demonstrating that
	            either the ATP-induced inhibition of PFK and the reversion of
	            this inhibition by F2,6BP occur through the same molecular
	            mechanism, i.e., the displacement of the oligomeric equilibrium
	            of the enzyme. This conclusion is arrived assessing the effects
	            of ATP and F2,6BP on PFK inactivation through two distinct ways
	            to dissociate the enzyme: (a) upon incubation at 50 degrees C, or
	            (b) incubating the enzyme with guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl).
	            Our results reveal that temperature- and GdmCl-induced
	            inactivation of PFK prove remarkably more effective in the
	            presence 5mM ATP than in the absence of additives. On the other
	            hand, the presence of 100 nM F2,6BP attenuate the effects of both
	            high-temperature exposition and GdmCl on PFK, even in the
	            simultaneous presence of 5mM ATP. These data support the
	            hypothesis that ATP shifts the oligomeric equilibrium of PFK
	            towards the smaller conformations, while F2,6BP acts in the
	            opposite direction. This conclusion leads to important
	            information about the molecular mechanism by which PFK is

	            6-bisphosphate. It has been suggested that both sites are shared
	            across the interface between subunits aligned in an antiparallel
	            orientation, the N-terminal half of one subunit facing the
	            C-terminal half of the other. The composition of these binding
	            sites and the way in which subunits interact to form the dimer
	            within the tetrameric enzyme have been reexamined by systematic
	            point mutations to alanine of key amino acid residues of human
	            muscle phosphofructokinase. We found that residues His-199,
	            His-298, Arg-201, and Arg-292 contribute to the catalytic site
	            and not to the allosteric site, because their mutation decreased

	            In contrast, residues Arg-566, Arg-655, and His-661 were critical
	            components of the fructose bisphosphate allosteric site, because

	            to form the two catalytic sites/dimer and the C-terminal halves
	            forming the allosteric sites. Additionally, mutation of certain

	            Based on the effect of various ligands on immunoreactivity,
	            specific regions involved in ligand-induced conformational
	            changes were identified. Adjacent epitopic regions, designated
	            Regions F and G and located in the N- and C-terminal domains,
	            respectively, were selectively affected by inhibitory hexose
	            6-phosphates (or analogs), marking these regions as being
	            involved in transmission of the conformational signal from the
	            regulatory N-terminal domain to the catalytic C-terminal domain.
	            Consistent with this, the Ki for inhibition of the enzyme by the

	            markedly increased by Mabs binding in these regions, but

	            with Mabs recognizing conformationally sensitive epitopes in

	            binding of substrate hexoses that induce closure of a cleft in

	            conformation, thereby preventing closure of the cleft required
	            for progression of the catalytic cycle, can account for the
	            marked decrease in Vmax that results from binding of these Mabs.
	            Reactivity with Mabs binding to Region H was also decreased in

	            between the N- and C-terminal domains, with the overall structure
	            of the N-terminal domain being "tighter" and with a major
	            component of ligand-induced conformational changes being focused
	            in the C-terminal domain. Based on a previously proposed

	            but destabilized the N-terminal domain, while the chelated forms
	            of the other nucleoside triphosphates were similar to the
	            unchelated forms in their effect on proteolysis; the unique

	            in quantities adequate for characterization. The N fragment (mol

	            indicating that the kappa cat is virtually identical for both
	            species. Unlike the parent enzyme, the C fragment is quite
	            sensitive to inhibition by Pi (competitive vs ATP, noncompetitive
	            vs Glc); sulfate and arsenate, but not acetate, inhibit with
	            effectiveness similar to that seen with Pi. The Glc-6-P analog, 1
	            ,5-anhydroglucitol-6-P, also inhibits the C fragment (competitive

	            analog of ATP, and are eluted by hexose 6-phosphates competitive
	            with nucleotide binding to the parent enzyme. Based on the

	            resembling those seen for the binding of these ligands to the
	            parent enzyme. Synergistic interactions between the hexose and
	            hexose-6-P binding sites, previously seen with the parent enzyme,
	            are also observed with the C fragment but not the N fragment. The
	            existence of binding sites for hexoses and hexose 6-phosphates on
	            both halves conflicts with previous binding studies demonstrating
	            a single hexose binding site and a single hexose 6-phosphate
	            binding site on the intact 100-kDa enzyme, leading to the
	            conclusion that one of each pair of sites must be latent in the
	            intact enzyme, becoming manifest only in the isolated discrete
	            halves. Several investigators have previously suggested that the

	            of a gene encoding an ancestral 50-kDa Glc-6-P-insensitive
	            hexokinase, similar to the present-day yeast enzyme, with

	            mM and an uncompetitive inhibition constant (K(iu)) of 3.04 +/-
	            0.74 mM]. Based on docking calculations, a model for BTC binding

	            isoenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3 and
	            PDK4) identified thus far in mammals were analysed. It appeared
	            that expression of these isoenzymes occurs in a tissue-specific
	            manner. The mRNA for isoenzyme PDK1 was found almost exclusively
	            in rat heart. The mRNA for PDK3 was most abundantly expressed in
	            rat testis. The message for PDK2 was present in all tissues
	            tested but the level was low in spleen and lung. The mRNA for
	            PDK4 was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart.
	            The specific activities of the isoenzymes varied 25-fold, from
	            50nmol/min per mg for PDK2 to 1250nmol/min per mg for PDK3.
	            Apparent Ki values of the isoenzymes for the synthetic analogue
	            of pyruvate, dichloroacetate, varied 40-fold, from 0.2 mM for
	            PDK2 to 8 mM for PDK3. The isoenzymes were also different with
	            respect to their ability to respond to NADH and NADH plus
	            acetyl-CoA. NADH alone stimulated the activities of PDK1 and PDK2
	            by 20 and 30\% respectively. NADH plus acetyl-CoA activated these
	            isoenzymes nearly 200 and 300\%. Under comparable conditions,
	            isoenzyme PDK3 was almost completely unresponsive to NADH, and
	            NADH plus acetyl-CoA caused inhibition rather than activation.
	            Isoenzyme PDK4 was activated almost 2-fold by NADH, but NADH plus
	            acetyl-CoA did not activate above the level seen with NADH alone.
	            These results provide the first evidence that the unique tissue
	            distribution and kinetic characteristics of the isoenzymes of PDK
	            are among the major factors responsible for tissue-specific
	            regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.},

	abstract = {Large-scale kinetic models are used for designing, predicting,
	            and understanding the metabolic responses of living cells.
	            Kinetic models are particularly attractive for the biosynthesis
	            of target molecules in cells as they are typically better than
	            other types of models at capturing the complex cellular
	            biochemistry. Using simpler stoichiometric models as scaffolds,
	            kinetic models are built around a steady-state flux profile and a
	            metabolite concentration vector that are typically determined via
	            optimization. However, as the underlying optimization problem is
	            underdetermined, even after incorporating available experimental
	            omics data, one cannot uniquely determine the operational
	            configuration in terms of metabolic fluxes and metabolite
	            concentrations. As a result, some reactions can operate in either
	            the forward or reverse direction while still agreeing with the
	            observed physiology. Here, we analyze how the underlying
	            uncertainty in intracellular fluxes and concentrations affects
	            predictions of constructed kinetic models and their design in
	            metabolic engineering and systems biology studies. To this end,
	            we integrated the omics data of optimally grown Escherichia coli
	            into a stoichiometric model and constructed populations of
	            non-linear large-scale kinetic models of alternative steady-state
	            solutions consistent with the physiology of the E. coli aerobic
	            metabolism. We performed metabolic control analysis (MCA) on
	            these models, highlighting that MCA-based metabolic engineering
	            decisions are strongly affected by the selected steady state and
	            appear to be more sensitive to concentration values rather than
	            flux values. To incorporate this into future studies, we propose
	            a workflow for moving towards more reliable and robust
	            predictions that are consistent with all alternative steady-state
	            solutions. This workflow can be applied to all kinetic models to
	            improve the consistency and accuracy of their predictions.
	            Additionally, we show that, irrespective of the alternative
	            steady-state solution, increased activity of phosphofructokinase
	            and decreased ATP maintenance requirements would improve cellular
	            growth of optimally grown E. coli. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

	            'whole-cell' biological simulations is rapidly developing.
	            However, the predictive capabilities of these simulations are
	            hindered by the availability of parameter values, which are often
	            difficult or even impossible to obtain experimentally and must
	            therefore be estimated. Using E. coli's glycolytic network as a
	            model system, we describe and apply a new method which can
	            estimate the values of all the system's 102 parameters - fit to
	            observations from studies of proteomics, metabolomics, enzyme
	            kinetics and chemical energetics - and find that the resulting
	            metabolic models are not only well-fit, but also dynamically
	            stable. An analysis of how well parameter values in the network
	            were determined by the training data revealed that over 80\% of
	            the parameter values were not well-specified. Moreover, the
	            distribution of well-determined values was biased to a specific
	            part of the network and against certain types of experimental
	            data. Our results also suggest that perturbing the functional,
	            energetic space of parameters (rather than traditional metabolic
	            parameters) is a superior strategy for exploring the space of
	            biological dynamics. The estimated parameter values matched both
	            training data and previously withheld validation data within an
	            order of magnitude for over 85\% of the data points; notably, the
	            area of greatest frustration in the network was also the most
	            fully determined. Finally, our estimation method showed that
	            fidelity to physiological observations such as network response
	            time is enforced at the cost of fit to molecular parameter
	            values. In summary, our reformulation enables estimation of
	            accurate, biologically relevant parameters, generates insight
	            into the biology of the simulated network, and appears
	            generalizable to any biochemical network - potentially including

	            1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) has been demonstrated. These
	            multimolecular forms result from the random polymerization of two
	            distinct subunits, M (muscle type) and L (liver type), to form
	            all possible tetrameters-i.e., M(4), M(3)L, M(2)L(2), ML(3), and
	            L(4). Partially purified muscle and liver PFKs were hybridized by
	            dissociation at low pH and then recombination at neutrality.
	            Three hybrid species were generated in addition to the two
	            parental isozymes, to yield an entire five-membered set. The
	            various species could be consistently and reproducibly separated
	            from one another by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 8.0 with a
	            concave elution gradient of salt. Under similar experimental
	            conditions, erythrocyte PFK from hemolysates was also resolved
	            into five species chromatographically indistinguishable from
	            those produced in the above experiment. Immunological and kinetic
	            studies of the isozymes provided corroborative evidence to
	            support the proposed subunit structures. Erythrocyte PFK was
	            found to have kinetic properties intermediate between those of
	            muscle and liver PFK and was neutralized only 50\% by an
	            antiserum against muscle PFK that completely neutralized muscle
	            PFK. These data demonstrate that muscle and liver PFKs are

	            erythrocyte PFK is a heterogeneous mixture of all five isozymes.
	            The structural heterogeneity of erythrocyte PFK provides a
	            molecular genetic basis for the differential organ involvement
	            observed in some inherited PFK deficiency states in which
	            myopathy or hemolysis or both can occur.},

	            natural fructose-2,6-P2 show identical effects on the allosteric

	            activators such as fructose-1,6-P2. The rates of the reaction
	            catalyzed by the enzymes under the above conditions are

	            molecules targeting to activate PKM2 through adequate
	            computational methods combined with biological activity
	            experiments. METHODS: The structure-based virtual screening was
	            utilized to screen effective activator targeting PKM2 from ZINC
	            database. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to
	            evaluate the stability of the small molecule-binding PKM2 complex
	            systems. Then, cell survival experiments, glutaraldehyde
	            crosslinking reaction, western blot, and qPCR experiments were
	            used to detect the effects of top hits on various cancer cells
	            and the targeting specificity of PKM2. RESULTS: Two small
	            molecules in 1,5-2H-pyrrole-dione were obtained after virtual
	            screening. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ZINC08383544
	            specifically activated PKM2 and affected the expression of
	            upstream and downstream genes of PKM2 during glycolysis, leading
	            to the inhibition of tumour cell growth. These results indicate
	            that ZINC08383544 conforms to the characteristics of PKM2
	            activator and is potential to be a novel PKM2 activator as
	            antitumour drug. DISCUSSION: This work proves that ZINC08383544
	            promotes the formation of PKM2 tetramer, effectively blocks PKM2
	            nuclear translocation, and inhibits the growth of tumour, and
	            ZINC08383544 may be a novel activator of PKM2. This work may

	            required for active site formation. Here we report the refined

	            closed form T. brucei PGK in complex with the nucleotide analogue
	            AMP-PNP. In the 180 000 Da asymmetric unit of the ternary complex
	            , four closed form PGK molecules appear to be arranged as two

	            has brought them together and in-line for catalysis. The
	            pseudoternary complex subunits exhibit a similar hinge closure
	            but contain, instead of 3-phosphoglycerate, a single phosphate
	            molecule bound in the active site. This phosphate binds to a site
	            expected for the 1-position phosphate of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate,
	            hence providing information for the binding mode for this

	            phosphate groups of the substrate, 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, and
	            the product, ATP, reveals that in each case only two of the three

	abstract = {The rates of the forward and reverse reactions of
	            triosephosphate isomerase catalyzed by the wild-type and by a
	            sluggish mutant enzyme have been studied in the absence and the
	            presence of several viscosogenic agents. For the mutant enzyme,
	            the kcat for which is some 103 times less than that for the
	            wild-type enzyme, the value of keil/Km with glyceraldehyde
	            phosphate as substrate is almost unaffected by the presence of
	            sucrose or glycerol, even though the concentration of the
	            aldehyde form of the substrate is smaller because of hemiacetal
	            formation. [The nature and relative amounts of the various forms
	            of trióse phosphate present in solution (free carbonyl forms,
	            hydrates, dimers, hemiacetal adducts) have been evaluated by 31P
	            NMR and are presented in the Appendix.] The viscosogenic agents
	            cause the substrate to bind more tightly to the enzyme, roughly
	            compensating for the lower substrate concentration. With
	            dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate, the values of k{
	            \textasciicircum}/Km for the mutant enzyme increase with the
	            addition of viscosogenic agent, consistent with the tighter
	            binding of substrate without (in this case) any concomitant loss
	            due to hemiketal formation. These results for the mutant enzyme
	            (known to be limited in rate by an enolization step in the
	            catalytic mechanism) can be used to interpret the behavior of the
	            wild-type enzyme. Plots of the relative values of k{
	            \textasciicircum}/Km for catalysis by the wild-type enzyme
	            (normalized with the corresponding data for the mutant enzyme)
	            against the relative viscosity have slopes close to unity, as
	            predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation for a cleanly diffusive
	            process. In the presence of polymeric viscosogenic additives such
	            as polyethylene glycol), polyacrylamide, or ficoll, no effect on
	            kCñl/Km is seen for the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the
	            expectation that molecular diffusion rates are unaffected by the
	            macroviscosity and are only slowed by the presence of smaller
	            agents that raise the microviscosity. These results show that the
	            reaction catalyzed by the wild-type triosephosphate isomerase is
	            limited by the rate at which glyceraldehyde phosphate encounters,
	            or departs from, the active site. Diffusion is a barrier on the
	            free energy surface of every bimolecular process. Since two
	            molecules must collide before they can react, the rate at which
	            the reactants diffuse together sets an upper limit on the rate at
	            which a bimolecular transformation can occur. This same limit
	            applies, of course, to reactions that are subject to homogeneous
	            catalysis, including acid-and base-catalyzed processes and
	            enzyme-cata-lyzed reactions. Although the rate-determining steps
	            in reactions catalyzed by enzymes have usually been considered to
	            be those involving the chemical interconversion of the enzyme
	            bound substrates, there is evidence that for many en-zymatic
	            reactions the rate-limiting transition state is diffusive
	            (Cleland, 1975). In these cases, the transition-state free
	            energies for the enzyme-mediated substrate-product
	            intercon-version will be lower than those for the diffusion
	            together (or apart) of the enzyme and its substrate. Upper limits
	            for the second-order rate constants of bi-molecular reactions in
	            solution that are diffusion controlled have been proposed from
	            theoretical considerations. The earliest model depicted the two
	            reactants as spheres of homogeneous reactivity (Smoluchowski,
	            1917). This picture is inappropriate for enzyme-catalyzed
	            reactions because the active site of an enzyme generally occupies
	            only a small fraction of the surface of the protein (Nakatani \&
	            Dunford, 1979). diffusion-controlled enzyme-catalyzed reaction
	            have been made by modeling the active site as a small hemisphere
	            on the surface of an otherwise inert spherical protein (Alberty
	            \& Hammes, 1958). Recent treatments have incorporated more
	            detailed (and possibly more realistic) geometrical constraints
	            (Sole \& Stockmayer, 1973; Schurr \& Schmitz, 1976; Samson \&
	            Deutch, 1978; Chou \& Zhou, 1982). These studies generally
	            predict that the second-order rate constant for a diffusion
	            limited enzyme-catalyzed reaction will be in the range of
	            10s-1010 M\_1 s'1, this range being at the upper end of the
	            observed rates of many enzyme-substrate and protein-ligand
	            reactions (Hammes \& Schimmel, 1970). The observed second order
	            rate constant can, of course, be considerably below this range,
	            if the substrate only binds to a minor form of the enzyme or if
	            the enzyme must find a rare form of the substrate. To conclude
	            merely from the absolute value of a second-order rate constant
	            that a particular process is diffusion controlled is clearly
	            unsatisfactory, and a direct experimental test is needed. Since
	            the frequency at which the reacting species collide determines
	            the rate of a diffusion-limited process, we must determine the
	            effect of altering the collision frequency on the second-order
	            rate constant. One approach has been to increase the frequency of
	            collisions by attaching one of the reactants to a rotating disk.
	            The rotating disk has well-defined hydrodynamics (Albery, 1975)
	            and is a useful device for studying the effect of mass transport
	            on the rate of a heterogeneous process. Thus chemical reagents
	            (Root et al., 1981), enzymes (Castner \& Wingard, 1984), and
	            cells (Dunn \& Ireland, 1984) have been attached to rotating
	            disks, and the effect of rotation speed on rate has been
	            determined. Although © 1988 American Chemical Society},

	            we present evidence that the conservation is responsible for the
	            unique properties of the muscle FBPase isozyme: high sensitivity
	            to AMP and Ca(2+) inhibition and the high affinity to muscle
	            aldolase, which is a factor desensitizing muscle FBPase toward
	            AMP and Ca(2+). The first N-terminal residue affecting the
	            affinity of muscle FBPase to aldolase is arginine 3. On the other
	            hand, the first residue significantly influencing the kinetics of
	            muscle FBPase is proline 5. Truncation from 5-7 N-terminal
	            residues of the enzyme not only decreases its affinity to
	            aldolase but also reduces its k-(cat) and activation by Mg(2+),
	            and desensitizes FBPase to inhibition by AMP and calcium ions.
	            Deletion of the first 10 amino acids of muscle FBPase abolishes
	            cooperativity of Mg(2+) activation and results in biphasic
	            inhibition of the enzyme by AMP. Moreover, this truncation lowers
	            affinity of muscle FBPase to aldolase about 14 times, making it
	            resemble the liver isozyme. We suggest that the existence of
	            highly AMP-sensitive muscle-like FBPase, activity of which is
	            regulated by metabolite-dependent interaction with aldolase
	            enables the precise regulation of muscle energy expenditures and
	            might contributed to the evolutionary success of vertebrates.

	abstract = {Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the main platform for
	            production of biotherapeutics in the biopharmaceutical industry.
	            However, relatively little is known about the metabolism of CHO
	            cells in cell culture. In this work, metabolism of CHO cells was
	            studied at the growth phase and early stationary phase using
	            isotopic tracers and mass spectrometry. CHO cells were grown in
	            fed-batch culture over a period of six days. On days 2 and 4, [1,
	            2-(13)C] glucose was introduced and the labeling of intracellular
	            metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
	            (GC-MS) at 6, 12 and 24h following the introduction of tracer.
	            Intracellular metabolic fluxes were quantified from measured
	            extracellular rates and (13)C-labeling dynamics of intracellular
	            metabolites using non-stationary (13)C-metabolic flux analysis
	            ((13)C-MFA). The flux results revealed significant rewiring of
	            intracellular metabolic fluxes in the transition from growth to
	            non-growth, including changes in energy metabolism, redox
	            metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis.
	            At the exponential phase, CHO cell metabolism was characterized
	            by a high flux of glycolysis from glucose to lactate, anaplerosis
	            from pyruvate to oxaloacetate and from glutamate to
	            α-ketoglutarate, and cataplerosis though malic enzyme. At the
	            stationary phase, the flux map was characterized by a reduced
	            flux of glycolysis, net lactate uptake, oxidative pentose
	            phosphate pathway flux, and reduced rate of anaplerosis. The
	            fluxes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and TCA cycle were similar at
	            the exponential and stationary phase. The results presented here
	            provide a solid foundation for future studies of CHO cell
	            metabolism for applications such as cell line development and
	            medium optimization for high-titer production of recombinant
	            proteins. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this work, a kinetic-metabolic model previously developed for
	            CHO cells is used to study glycolysis regulation. The model is
	            assessed for its biological relevance by analyzing its ability to
	            simulate metabolic events induced following a hypoxic
	            perturbation. Feedback and feedforward regulatory mechanisms
	            known to occur to either inhibit or activate fluxes of glycolysis
	            , are implemented in various combined scenarios and their effects
	            on the metabolic response were analyzed. This study aims at
	            characterizing the role of intermediates of glycolysis and of the
	            cell energetic state, described as the AMP-to-ATP ratio, as
	            inhibitors and activators of glycolysis pathway. In addition to
	            the glycolysis pathway, we here describe the transient metabolic
	            response of pathways that are connected to glycolysis, such as
	            the pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, cell bioenergetics
	            system, glutamine and amino acids metabolisms. Taken individually
	            , each regulatory mechanism leads to an oscillatory behavior in
	            response to a hypoxic perturbation, while their combination
	            clearly damps oscillations. However, only the addition of the
	            cell energetic state to the regulatory mechanisms results in a
	            non-oscillating response leading to metabolic flux rate
	            rearrangement corresponding to the anaerobic metabolism expected
	            to prevail under hypoxic conditions. We thus demonstrate in this
	            work, from model simulations, that the robustness of a cell
	            energetic metabolism can be described from a combination of
	            feedback and feedforward inhibition and activation regulatory
	            mechanisms of glycolysis fluxes, involving intermediates of
	            glycolysis and the cell energetic state itself. Copyright © 2014

	abstract = {Increased glucose consumption distinguishes cancer cells from
	            normal cells and is known as the "Warburg effect" because of
	            increased glycolysis. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a key
	            glycolytic enzyme, a hallmark of aggressive cancers, and believed
	            to be the major enzyme responsible for pyruvate-to-lactate
	            conversion. To elucidate its role in tumor growth, we disrupted
	            both the LDHA and LDHB genes in two cancer cell lines (human
	            colon adenocarcinoma and murine melanoma cells). Surprisingly,
	            neither LDHA nor LDHB knockout strongly reduced lactate
	            secretion. In contrast, double knockout (LDHA/B-DKO) fully
	            suppressed LDH activity and lactate secretion. Furthermore, under
	            normoxia, LDHA/B-DKO cells survived the genetic block by shifting
	            their metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), entailing
	            a 2-fold reduction in proliferation rates in vitro and in vivo
	            compared with their WT counterparts. Under hypoxia (1\% oxygen),
	            however, LDHA/B suppression completely abolished in vitro growth,
	            consistent with the reliance on OXPHOS. Interestingly, activation
	            of the respiratory capacity operated by the LDHA/B-DKO genetic
	            block as well as the resilient growth were not consequences of
	            long-term adaptation. They could be reproduced pharmacologically
	            by treating WT cells with an LDHA/B-specific inhibitor (GNE-140).
	            These findings demonstrate that the Warburg effect is not only
	            based on high LDHA expression, as both LDHA and LDHB need to be
	            deleted to suppress fermentative glycolysis. Finally, we
	            demonstrate that the Warburg effect is dispensable even in
	            aggressive tumors and that the metabolic shift to OXPHOS caused
	            by LDHA/B genetic disruptions is responsible for the tumors'
	            escape and growth. © 2018 Ždralević et al.},

	            may result in a decline in viability, productivity, and possible
	            alterations in product quality. In cultured cells, lactate is
	            produced during glycolysis through irreversible conversion of
	            phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and then lactate via sequential
	            function of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
	            enzymes. In the process of cell line development (CLD), two
	            lactogenic cell lines expressing different antibody molecules are
	            identified. The lactogenic behaviors of these cell lines can be
	            differentially mitigated through optimization of either nutrient
	            feeds or culture pH, depending on the cell line. Analysis of
	            various proteins involved in the glycolysis pathway reveal a
	            direct correlation between the pyruvate kinase muscle-1 (PKM-1)
	            isoform levels and lactogenic behavior. CRISPR mediated knockout
	            of the PKM-1 isoform abolishes lactate accumulation even under

	            productivity, viability, and growth without displaying lactogenic
	            behavior is identified. Targeted deletion of PKM in CHO cells may
	            be tolerated due to expression of PKL (liver) and PKR (red blood
	            cell) isoforms of pyruvate kinase. All together, these findings
	            suggest that PKM-1 up-regulation during antibody production could
	            trigger lactogenic behavior and that this enzyme is dispensable

	            increasing the pool of glycolytic biosynthetic intermediates, and
	            increasing lactate production that affects the tumor
	            microenvironment, the Warburg Effect is important for the growth
	            and proliferation of tumor cells. The mechanisms by which a cell
	            acquires the Warburg Effect phenotype are regulated by the
	            expression of numerous oncogenes, including oncogenic tyrosine
	            kinases. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases play a significant role in
	            phosphorylating and regulating the activity of numerous metabolic
	            enzymes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes increases
	            the activities of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, thus
	            promoting increased glycolytic rate and tumor cell proliferation.
	            Paradoxically however, tyrosine phosphorylation of pyruvate
	            kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) results in decreased PKM2 activity, and
	            this decrease in PKM2 activity promotes the Warburg Effect.
	            Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PKM2 is also able to
	            act as a protein kinase using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a

	            Integration of fluxomics and metabolomics data, and
	            thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis contribute to
	            improved understanding of steady-state properties of metabolism.
	            However, knowledge about kinetics and enzyme activities though

	            remains scarce and involves uncertainty. Here, we present a

	            the kinetic parameters that correspond to a certain physiology as
	            it is described by a given metabolic flux profile and a given

	            parameters, and hence we are able to reduce the uncertainty in

	            parameters for glucose-fed E. coli producing 1,4-butanediol and

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanistic description of enzyme kinetics in a
	            dynamic model of metabolism requires specifying the numerical
	            values of a large number of kinetic parameters. The
	            parameterization challenge is often addressed through the use of
	            simplifying approximations to form reaction rate laws with
	            reduced numbers of parameters. Whether such simplified models can
	            reproduce dynamic characteristics of the full system is an
	            important question. RESULTS: In this work, we compared the local
	            transient response properties of dynamic models constructed using
	            rate laws with varying levels of approximation. These approximate
	            rate laws were: 1) a Michaelis-Menten rate law with measured
	            enzyme parameters, 2) a Michaelis-Menten rate law with
	            approximated parameters, using the convenience kinetics
	            convention, 3) a thermodynamic rate law resulting from a
	            metabolite saturation assumption, and 4) a pure chemical reaction
	            mass action rate law that removes the role of the enzyme from the
	            reaction kinetics. We utilized in vivo data for the human red
	            blood cell to compare the effect of rate law choices against the
	            backdrop of physiological flux and concentration differences. We
	            found that the Michaelis-Menten rate law with measured enzyme
	            parameters yields an excellent approximation of the full system
	            dynamics, while other assumptions cause greater discrepancies in
	            system dynamic behavior. However, iteratively replacing
	            mechanistic rate laws with approximations resulted in a model
	            that retains a high correlation with the true model behavior.
	            Investigating this consistency, we determined that the order of
	            magnitude differences among fluxes and concentrations in the
	            network were greatly influential on the network dynamics. We
	            further identified reaction features such as thermodynamic
	            reversibility, high substrate concentration, and lack of
	            allosteric regulation, which make certain reactions more suitable
	            for rate law approximations. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work
	            generally supports the use of approximate rate laws when building
	            large scale kinetic models, due to the key role that
	            physiologically meaningful flux and concentration ranges play in
	            determining network dynamics. However, we also showed that
	            detailed mechanistic models show a clear benefit in prediction
	            accuracy when data is available. The work here should help to
	            provide guidance to future kinetic modeling efforts on the choice
	            of rate law and parameterization approaches.},

	            affect their in-vivo concentrations. The recently achieved
	            experimental capability to measure the concentrations of many

	            hypothesis possible. Here, we analyze such recently available
	            data sets of metabolite concentrations within E. coli, S.
	            cerevisiae, B. subtilis and human. Overall, these data sets
	            encompass more than twenty conditions, each containing dozens
	            (28-108) of simultaneously measured metabolites. We test for
	            correlations with various physico-chemical properties and find
	            that the number of charged atoms, non-polar surface area,
	            lipophilicity and solubility consistently correlate with
	            concentration. In most data sets, a change in one of these
	            properties elicits a {\textasciitilde}100 fold increase in
	            metabolite concentrations. We find that the non-polar surface

	abstract = {The implementation of model-based designs in metabolic
	            engineering and synthetic biology may fail. One of the reasons
	            for this failure is that only a part of the real-world complexity
	            is included in models. Still, some knowledge can be simplified
	            and taken into account in the form of optimization constraints to
	            improve the feasibility of model-based designs of metabolic
	            pathways in organisms. Some constraints (mass balance, energy
	            balance, and steady-state assumption) serve as a basis for many
	            modelling approaches. There are others (total enzyme activity
	            constraint and homeostatic constraint) proposed decades ago, but
	            which are frequently ignored in design development. Several new
	            approaches of cellular analysis have made possible the
	            application of constraints like cell size, surface, and resource
	            balance. Constraints for kinetic and stoichiometric models are
	            grouped according to their applicability preconditions in (1)
	            general constraints, (2) organism-level constraints, and (3)
	            experiment-level constraints. General constraints are universal
	            and are applicable for any system. Organism-level constraints are
	            applicable for biological systems and usually are
	            organism-specific, but these constraints can be applied without
	            information about experimental conditions. To apply
	            experimental-level constraints, peculiarities of the organism and
	            the experimental set-up have to be taken into account to
	            calculate the values of constraints. The limitations of
	            applicability of particular constraints for kinetic and

	            kinetic model of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism. The
	            main model assumptions were based on the results of metabolic and
	            regulatory reconstruction of the system and thorough model
	            verification with experimental data. The development and
	            verification of the model included several stages, which allowed
	            us to take into account both in vitro and in vivo experimental
	            data and avoid the ambiguity that frequently occurs in detailed
	            models of biochemical pathways. The choice of the level of detail
	            for the mathematical description of enzymatic reaction rates and
	            the evaluation of parameter values were based on available
	            published data. Validation of the complete model of the metabolic
	            pathway describing specific physiological states was based on
	            fluxomics and metabolomics data. In particular, we developed a
	            model that describes aerobic growth of E. coli in continuous
	            culture with a limiting concentration of glucose. Such
	            modification of the model was used to integrate experimental
	            metabolomics data obtained in steady-state conditions for
	            wild-type E. coli and genetically modified strains, e.g. knockout
	            of the pyruvate kinase gene (pykA). Following analysis of the
	            model behaviour, and comparison of the coincidence between
	            predicted and experimental data, it was possible to investigate
	            the functional and regulatory properties of E. coli central
	            carbon metabolism. For example, a novel metabolic regulatory
	            mechanism for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase inhibition by
	            phosphoenolpyruvate was hypothesized, and the flux ratios between
	            the reactions catalysed by enzyme isoforms were predicted.

	abstract = {Kinetic models provide the means to understand and predict the
	            dynamic behaviour of enzymes upon different perturbations.
	            Despite their obvious advantages, classical parameterizations
	            require large amounts of data to fit their parameters.
	            Particularly, enzymes displaying complex reaction and regulatory
	            (allosteric) mechanisms require a great number of parameters and
	            are therefore often represented by approximate formulae, thereby
	            facilitating the fitting but ignoring many real kinetic
	            behaviours. Here, we show that full exploration of the plausible
	            kinetic space for any enzyme can be achieved using sampling
	            strategies provided a thermodynamically feasible parameterization
	            is used. To this end, we developed a General Reaction Assembly
	            and Sampling Platform (GRASP) capable of consistently
	            parameterizing and sampling accurate kinetic models using minimal
	            reference data. The former integrates the generalized MWC model
	            and the elementary reaction formalism. By formulating the
	            appropriate thermodynamic constraints, our framework enables
	            parameterization of any oligomeric enzyme kinetics without
	            sacrificing complexity or using simplifying assumptions. This
	            thermodynamically safe parameterization relies on the definition
	            of a reference state upon which feasible parameter sets can be
	            efficiently sampled. Uniform sampling of the kinetics space
	            enabled dissecting enzyme catalysis and revealing the impact of
	            thermodynamics on reaction kinetics. Our analysis distinguished
	            three reaction elasticity regions for common biochemical
	            reactions: a steep linear region (0{\textgreater} ΔGr {
	            \textgreater}-2 kJ/mol), a transition region (-2{\textgreater}
	            ΔGr {\textgreater}-20 kJ/mol) and a constant elasticity region
	            (ΔGr {\textless} -20 kJ/mol). We also applied this framework to
	            model more complex kinetic behaviours such as the monomeric
	            cooperativity of the mammalian glucokinase and the ultrasensitive
	            response of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of Escherichia
	            coli. In both cases, our approach described appropriately not
	            only the kinetic behaviour of these enzymes, but it also provided
	            insights about the particular features underpinning the observed
	            kinetics. Overall, this framework will enable systematic

	abstract = {There are over 120 types of brain tumor and approximately 45\%
	            of primary brain tumors are gliomas, of which glioblastoma
	            multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive with a median
	            survival rate of 14 months. Despite progress in our knowledge,
	            current therapies are unable to effectively combat primary brain
	            tumors and patient survival remains poor. Tumor metabolism is
	            important to consider in therapeutic approaches and is the focus
	            of numerous research investigations. Lactate dehydrogenase A
	            (LDHA) is a cytosolic enzyme, predominantly involved in anaerobic
	            and aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect); however, it has
	            multiple additional functions in non-neoplastic and neoplastic
	            tissues, which are not commonly known or discussed. This review
	            summarizes what is currently known about the function of LDHA and
	            identifies areas that would benefit from further exploration. The
	            current knowledge of the role of LDHA in the brain and its
	            potential as a therapeutic target for brain tumors will also be
	            highlighted. The Warburg effect appears to be universal in tumors
	            , including primary brain tumors, and LDHA (because of its
	            involvement with this process) has been identified as a potential
	            therapeutic target. Currently, there are, however, no suitable
	            LDHA inhibitors available for tumor therapies in the clinic. ©

	            challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of these
	            molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here, we
	            introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses
	            multiple steady-state observations of (13)C-resolved fluxes,
	            metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events
	            drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions.
	            Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and
	            identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent
	            regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events
	            drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription
	            mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP
	            pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved
	            measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some
	            dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts
	            between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that
	            pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory

	            steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming,

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic
	            model requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The
	            mathematical expressions depend on the underlying enzymatic
	            mechanism; they can become quite involved and may contain a large
	            number of parameters. Rate laws and enzyme parameters are still
	            unknown for most enzymes. RESULTS: We introduce a simple and
	            general rate law called "convenience kinetics". It can be derived
	            from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws
	            can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to
	            facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large
	            networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system
	            parameters: their values can be varied independently, without
	            violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by
	            expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free
	            energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium
	            constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover
	            rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for
	            inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular
	            energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and
	            enzyme. CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate
	            a biochemical network--manually or automatically--into a
	            dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It
	            implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and
	            inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can
	            be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical
	            form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and
	            optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a
	            least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates,
	            equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely
	            measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

	abstract = {Computational strain-design prediction accuracy has been the
	            focus for many recent efforts through the selective integration
	            of kinetic information into metabolic models. In general, kinetic
	            model prediction quality is determined by the range and scope of
	            genetic and/or environmental perturbations used during
	            parameterization. In this effort, we apply the k-OptForce
	            procedure on a kinetic model of E. coli core metabolism
	            constructed using the Ensemble Modeling (EM) method and
	            parameterized using multiple mutant strains data under aerobic
	            respiration with glucose as the carbon source. Minimal
	            interventions are identified that improve succinate yield under
	            both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to test the fidelity of
	            model predictions under both genetic and environmental
	            perturbations. Under aerobic condition, k-OptForce identifies
	            interventions that match existing experimental strategies while
	            pointing at a number of unexplored flux re-directions such as
	            routing glyoxylate flux through the glycerate metabolism to
	            improve succinate yield. Many of the identified interventions
	            rely on the kinetic descriptions that would not be discoverable
	            by a purely stoichiometric description. In contrast, under
	            fermentative (anaerobic) condition, k-OptForce fails to identify
	            key interventions including up-regulation of anaplerotic
	            reactions and elimination of competitive fermentative products.
	            This is due to the fact that the pathways activated under
	            anaerobic condition were not properly parameterized as only
	            aerobic flux data were used in the model construction. This study
	            shed light on the importance of condition-specific model
	            parameterization and provides insight on how to augment kinetic

	            approach. This approach is an extension of metabolic control
	            analysis (MCA), valid for large changes of enzyme and metabolite
	            levels. Furthermore, the presented framework combines MCA with
	            kinetic modeling, thereby also combining the merits of both
	            approaches. The linlog framework includes general expressions
	            giving the steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentrations as a
	            function of enzyme levels and extracellular concentrations, and a
	            metabolic design equation that allows direct calculation of
	            required enzyme levels for a desired steady state when control
	            and response coefficients are available. Expressions giving
	            control coefficients as a function of the enzyme levels are also
	            derived. The validity of the linlog approximation in metabolic

	            2.7.1.40) is analyzed when subject to periodic substrate
	            addition. The calculations are performed by using detailed rate
	            laws that have been derived for the enzymes of Escherichia coli.
	            Due to linear relationships between the metabolite concentrations
	            , the numerical solutions can be displayed inside a trapezium, so

	            systematically turning metabolic networks into kinetic models.
	            They should provide simple, general and biochemically plausible
	            formulae for reaction velocities and reaction elasticities. At
	            the same time, they need to respect thermodynamic relations
	            between the kinetic constants and the metabolic fluxes and
	            concentrations. RESULTS: We present a family of reversible rate
	            laws for reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various
	            types of regulation, including mass-action, Michaelis-Menten and
	            uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. With a
	            thermodynamically safe parameterization of these rate laws,
	            parameter sets obtained by model fitting, sampling or
	            optimization are guaranteed to lead to consistent chemical
	            equilibrium states. A reformulation using saturation values
	            yields simple formulae for rates and elasticities, which can be
	            easily adjusted to the given stationary flux distributions.
	            Furthermore, this formulation highlights the role of chemical
	            potential differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare
	            the modular rate laws to the thermodynamic-kinetic modelling
	            formalism and discuss a simplified rate law in which the reaction
	            rate directly depends on the reaction affinity. For automatic

	            transport function. Among them are the transporters for amino
	            acids. Fourteen of them, capable of transporting glutamine across
	            the plasma membrane, are found in four families: SLC1, SLC6, SLC7
	            , and SLC38. However, it is generally thought that the members of

	            Some of the glutamine transporters are obligatory exchangers
	            whereas some function as active transporters in one direction.
	            While most glutamine transporters mediate the influx of the amino

	            increasing attention on glutamine transporters in cancer biology
	            as potential drug targets for cancer treatment. Selective

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in bioinformatic techniques and analyses
	            have led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic
	            reconstructions. The size and complexity of such networks often
	            means that their potential behaviour can only be analysed with
	            constraint-based methods. Whilst requiring minimal experimental
	            data, such methods are unable to give insight into cellular
	            substrate concentrations. Instead, the long-term goal of systems
	            biology is to use kinetic modelling to characterize fully the
	            mechanics of each enzymatic reaction, and to combine such
	            knowledge to predict system behaviour. RESULTS: We describe a
	            method for building a parameterized genome-scale kinetic model of
	            a metabolic network. Simplified linlog kinetics are used and the
	            parameters are extracted from a kinetic model repository. We
	            demonstrate our methodology by applying it to yeast metabolism.
	            The resultant model has 956 metabolic reactions involving 820
	            metabolites, and, whilst approximative, has considerably broader
	            remit than any existing models of its type. Control analysis is
	            used to identify key steps within the system. CONCLUSIONS: Our

	            Coarse-grained molecular simulations reveal three compact

	            functions of the enzyme transketolase, which requires thiamin
	            diphosphate and a divalent metal ion for its activity. The
	            transketolase-catalysed reaction is part of the pentose phosphate
	            pathway, where transketolase appears to control the non-oxidative
	            branch of this pathway, although the overall flux of labelled
	            substrates remains controversial. Yeast transketolase is one of
	            several thiamin diphosphate dependent enzymes whose
	            three-dimensional structures have been determined. Together with
	            mutational analysis these structural data have led to detailed
	            understanding of thiamin diphosphate catalysed reactions. In the
	            homodimer transketolase the two catalytic sites, where
	            dihydroxyethyl groups are transferred from ketose donors to
	            aldose acceptors, are formed at the interface between the two
	            subunits, where the thiazole and pyrimidine rings of thiamin
	            diphosphate are bound. Transketolase is ubiquitous and more than
	            30 full-length sequences are known. The encoded protein sequences
	            contain two motifs of high homology; one common to all thiamin
	            diphosphate-dependent enzymes and the other a unique
	            transketolase motif. All characterised transketolases have
	            similar kinetic and physical properties, but the mammalian
	            enzymes are more selective in substrate utilisation than the
	            nonmammalian representatives. Since products of the
	            transketolase-catalysed reaction serve as precursors for a number
	            of synthetic compounds this enzyme has been exploited for
	            industrial applications. Putative mutant forms of transketolase,
	            once believed to predispose to disease, have not stood up to
	            scrutiny. However, a modification of transketolase is a marker
	            for Alzheimer's disease, and transketolase activity in
	            erythrocytes is a measure of thiamin nutrition. The cornea
	            contains a particularly high transketolase concentration,
	            consistent with the proposal that pentose phosphate pathway
	            activity has a role in the removal of light-generated radicals.},

	            mechanism based on systems biology approach. In the present study

	            overflow metabolism and the co-fermentation of multiple carbon
	            sources. The perturbation analysis was first made to understand
	            the nature of the feed-forward loop formed by the activation of
	            Pyk by FDP (F1,6BP), and the feed-back loop formed by the
	            inhibition of Pfk by PEP in the glycolysis. Those together with
	            the effect of transcription factor Cra caused by FDP level
	            affected the glycolysis activity. The PTS (phosphotransferase
	            system) acts as the feed-back system by repressing the glucose
	            uptake rate for the increase in the glucose uptake rate. It was
	            also shown that the increased PTS flux (or glucose consumption
	            rate) causes PEP/PYR ratio to be decreased, and EIIA-P, Cya,
	            cAMP-Crp decreased, where cAMP-Crp in turn repressed TCA cycle
	            and more acetate is formed. This was further verified by the
	            detailed computer simulation. In the case of multiple carbon
	            sources such as glucose and xylose, it was shown that the

	abstract = {Computational strain design protocols aim at the system-wide
	            identification of intervention strategies for the enhanced
	            production of biochemicals in microorganisms. Existing approaches
	            relying solely on stoichiometry and rudimentary constraint-based
	            regulation overlook the effects of metabolite concentrations and
	            substrate-level enzyme regulation while identifying metabolic
	            interventions. In this paper, we introduce k-OptForce, which
	            integrates the available kinetic descriptions of metabolic steps
	            with stoichiometric models to sharpen the prediction of
	            intervention strategies for improving the bio-production of a
	            chemical of interest. It enables identification of a minimal set
	            of interventions comprised of both enzymatic parameter changes
	            (for reactions with available kinetics) and reaction flux changes
	            (for reactions with only stoichiometric information). Application
	            of k-OptForce to the overproduction of L-serine in E. coli and
	            triacetic acid lactone (TAL) in S. cerevisiae revealed that the
	            identified interventions tend to cause less dramatic
	            rearrangements of the flux distribution so as not to violate
	            concentration bounds. In some cases the incorporation of kinetic
	            information leads to the need for additional interventions as
	            kinetic expressions render stoichiometry-only derived
	            interventions infeasible by violating concentration bounds,
	            whereas in other cases the kinetic expressions impart flux
	            changes that favor the overproduction of the target product
	            thereby requiring fewer direct interventions. A sensitivity
	            analysis on metabolite concentrations shows that the required
	            number of interventions can be significantly affected by changing
	            the imposed bounds on metabolite concentrations. Furthermore,
	            k-OptForce was capable of finding non-intuitive interventions
	            aiming at alleviating the substrate-level inhibition of key
	            enzymes in order to enhance the flux towards the product of
	            interest, which cannot be captured by stoichiometry-alone
	            analysis. This study paves the way for the integrated analysis of
	            kinetic and stoichiometric models and enables elucidating
	            system-wide metabolic interventions while capturing regulatory
	            and kinetic effects.},

	            the rates of superoxide production (measured indirectly as H2O2)
	            with glutamate+succinate (approximately 1100 pmol of H2O2 x

	            glutamate (approximately 80 pmol of H2O2 x min(-1) x mg(-1))
	            alone. Superoxide production with glutamate+succinate remained
	            high even at low substrate concentrations ({\textless} 1 mM), was

	            dynamic association/disassociation equilibria under native
	            conditions, thus creating an equilibrium of assembly states. Such
	            quaternary structure equilibria may be influenced in a
	            physiologically significant manner either by covalent
	            modification or by the non-covalent binding of ligands. This
	            review follows the evolution of ideas about homo-oligomeric
	            equilibria through the 20th and into the 21st centuries and the
	            relationship of these equilibria to allosteric regulation by the
	            non-covalent binding of ligands. A dynamic quaternary structure
	            equilibria is described where the dissociated state can have
	            alternate conformations that cannot reassociate to the original
	            multimer; the alternate conformations dictate assembly to
	            functionally distinct alternate multimers of finite

	            pyruvate across the impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane
	            (IMM). Despite long-standing acceptance that transport of
	            pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix by a carrier-mediated
	            process is required for the bulk of its metabolism, it has taken
	            almost 40 years to determine the molecular identity of an IMM

	            and phosphorylates PKM2 at Ser 37, but does not phosphorylate
	            PKM1. Phosphorylated PKM2 Ser 37 recruits PIN1 for cis-trans
	            isomerization of PKM2, which promotes PKM2 binding to importin α5
	            and translocating to the nucleus. Nuclear PKM2 acts as a
	            coactivator of β-catenin to induce c-Myc expression, resulting in
	            the upregulation of GLUT1, LDHA and, in a positive feedback loop,

	            regulation of the enzymatic activity of IDHs is crucial for their

	            phosphorylation of a strictly conserved serine residue at the
	            active site. Eukaryotic NADP-dependent IDHs (NADP-IDHs) have been
	            shown to have diverse important biological functions; however,
	            their regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Structural studies of
	            human cytosolic NADP-IDH (HcIDH) in complex with NADP and in
	            complex with NADP, isocitrate, and Ca2+ reveal three biologically
	            relevant conformational states of the enzyme that differ
	            substantially in the structure of the active site and in the

	            chelates the metal ion in the active form. The structural data
	            led us to propose a novel self-regulatory mechanism for HcIDH

	            (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human
	            brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid
	            residue of the IDH1 active site, resulting in loss of the

	            regulation of cellular metabolism, definite identification of
	            metabolic pathway alterations remains challenging and requires
	            sophisticated experimentation. METHODS: We applied a
	            comprehensive kinetic model of the central carbon metabolism
	            (CCM) to characterise metabolic reprogramming in murine liver
	            cancer. RESULTS: We show that relative differences of protein
	            abundances of metabolic enzymes obtained by mass spectrometry can
	            be used to assess their maximal velocity values. Model
	            simulations predicted tumour-specific alterations of various
	            components of the CCM, a selected number of which were
	            subsequently verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments.
	            Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the kinetic model to
	            identify metabolic pathways whose inhibition results in selective
	            tumour cell killing. CONCLUSIONS: Our systems biology approach

	            during proliferation and metastasis. Computational modeling of
	            genome-scale metabolic models is an effective approach for
	            designing new therapeutics targeting dysregulated cancer
	            metabolism by identifying metabolic enzymes crucial for
	            satisfying metabolic goals of cancer cells, but nearly all
	            previous studies neglect the existence of metabolic demands other
	            than biomass synthesis and trade-offs between these contradicting
	            metabolic demands. It is thus necessary to develop computational
	            models covering multiple metabolic objectives to study cancer
	            metabolism and identify novel metabolic targets. METHODS: We
	            developed a multi-objective optimization model for cancer cell
	            metabolism at genome-scale and an integrated, data-driven
	            workflow for analyzing the Pareto optimality of this model in
	            achieving multiple metabolic goals and identifying metabolic
	            enzymes crucial for maintaining cancer-associated metabolic
	            phenotypes. Using this workflow, we constructed cell
	            line-specific models for a panel of cancer cell lines and
	            identified lists of metabolic targets promoting or suppressing
	            cancer cell proliferation or the Warburg Effect. The targets were
	            then validated using knockdown and over-expression experiments in
	            cultured cancer cell lines. RESULTS: We found that the
	            multi-objective optimization model correctly predicted phenotypes
	            including cell growth rates, essentiality of metabolic genes and
	            cell line specific sensitivities to metabolic perturbations. To
	            our surprise, metabolic enzymes promoting proliferation
	            substantially overlapped with those suppressing the Warburg
	            Effect, suggesting that simply targeting the overlapping enzymes
	            may lead to complicated outcomes. We also identified lists of
	            metabolic enzymes important for maintaining rapid proliferation
	            or high Warburg Effect while having little effect on the other.
	            The importance of these enzymes in cancer metabolism predicted by
	            the model was validated by their association with cancer patient
	            survival and knockdown and overexpression experiments in a
	            variety of cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm
	            this multi-objective optimization model as a novel and effective

	            cancer cells and identifying cancer-associated metabolic

	            [GSH]) are essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis
	            and for modulating cellular metabolism. Reductive stress induced
	            by excessive levels of reduced NAD+ (NADH), reduced NADP+ (NADPH)
	            , and GSH is as harmful as oxidative stress and is implicated in
	            many pathological processes. Recent Advances: Reductive stress
	            broadens our view of the importance of cellular redox homeostasis
	            and the influences of an imbalanced redox niche on biological
	            functions, including cell metabolism. Critical Issues: The
	            distribution of cellular NAD(H), NADP(H), and GSH/GSH disulfide
	            is highly compartmentalized. Understanding how cells coordinate
	            different pools of redox couples under unstressed and stressed
	            conditions is critical for a comprehensive view of redox
	            homeostasis and stress. It is also critical to explore the
	            underlying mechanisms of reductive stress and its biological
	            consequences, including effects on energy metabolism. Future
	            Directions: Future studies are needed to investigate how
	            reductive stress affects cell metabolism and how cells adapt
	            their metabolism to reductive stress. Whether or not NADH
	            shuttles and mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide

	            stress is also a worthy pursuit. Developing strategies (e.g.,

	            In parallel, we consider the resulting available evidence, with a

	            metabolic scenarios of potential clinical relevance: the Warburg
	            effect, the reverse Warburg effect and glutamine addiction. At
	            the intracellular level, we construct a network of central
	            metabolism and perform flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate
	            metabolic fluxes; at the cellular level, we exploit this
	            metabolic network to calculate parameters for a coarse-grained
	            description of cellular growth kinetics; and at the multicellular
	            level, we incorporate these kinetic schemes into the cellular
	            automata of an agent-based model (ABM), iDynoMiCS. This ABM
	            evaluates the reaction-diffusion of the metabolites, cellular
	            division and motion over a simulation domain. Our multi-scale
	            simulations suggest that the Warburg effect provides a growth
	            advantage to the tumor cells under resource limitation. However,
	            we identify a non-monotonic dependence of growth rate on the
	            strength of glycolytic pathway. On the other hand, the reverse
	            Warburg scenario provides an initial growth advantage in tumors
	            that originate deeper in the tissue. The metabolic profile of
	            stromal cells considered in this scenario allows more oxygen to
	            reach the tumor cells in the deeper tissue and thus promotes
	            tumor growth at earlier stages. Lastly, we suggest that glutamine
	            addiction does not confer a selective advantage to tumor growth
	            with glutamine acting as a carbon source in the tricarboxylic
	            acid (TCA) cycle, any advantage of glutamine uptake must come
	            through other pathways not included in our model (e.g., as a
	            nitrogen donor). Our analysis illustrates the importance of
	            accounting explicitly for spatial and temporal evolution of tumor
	            microenvironment in the interpretation of metabolic scenarios and
	            hence provides a basis for further studies, including evaluation

	            requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that
	            occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from
	            biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as
	            the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to
	            quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the

	            intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of

	            However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic

	abstract = {Kinetic models of metabolism are crucial to understand the inner
	            workings of cell metabolism. By taking into account enzyme
	            regulation, detailed kinetic models can provide accurate
	            predictions of metabolic fluxes. Comprehensive consideration of
	            kinetic regulation requires highly parameterized non-linear
	            models, which are challenging to build and fit using available
	            modelling tools. Here, we present a computational package
	            implementing the GRASP framework for building detailed kinetic
	            models of cellular metabolism. By defining the mechanisms of
	            enzyme regulation and a reference state described by reaction
	            fluxes and their corresponding Gibbs free energy ranges, GRASP
	            can efficiently sample an arbitrarily large population of
	            thermodynamically feasible kinetic models. If additional
	            experimental data are available (fluxes, enzyme and metabolite
	            concentrations), these can be integrated to generate models that
	            closely reproduce these observations using an approximate
	            Bayesian computation fitting framework. Within the same framework
	            , model selection tasks can be readily performed.GRASP is
	            implemented as an open-source package in the MATLAB environment.
	            The software runs in Windows, macOS and Linux, is documented
	            (graspk.readthedocs.io) and unit-tested. GRASP is freely

	            kinetics of a fed-batch Chinese hamster ovary cell culture
	            process in 5,000-L bioreactors. The kinetic model consists of six
	            differential equations, which describe dynamics of viable cell
	            density and concentrations of glucose, glutamine, ammonia,
	            lactate, and the antibody fusion protein B1 (B1). The kinetic

	            training data set that comprised of seven cell culture runs using

	            maintenance during the late phase of the cell cultures, whereas
	            the maintenance coefficient for glutamine was negligible. Finally

	abstract = {Statistical models can involve implicitly defined quantities,
	            such as solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations
	            (ODEs), that unavoidably need to be numerically approximated in
	            order to evaluate the model. The approximation error inherently
	            biases statistical inference results, but the amount of this bias
	            is generally unknown and often ignored in Bayesian parameter
	            inference. We propose a computationally efficient method for
	            verifying the reliability of posterior inference for such models,
	            when the inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo
	            methods. We validate the efficiency and reliability of our
	            workflow in experiments using simulated and real data, and
	            different ODE solvers. We highlight problems that arise with
	            commonly used adaptive ODE solvers, and propose robust and
	            effective alternatives which, accompanied by our workflow, can
	            now be taken into use without losing reliability of the
	            inferences.},

	abstract = {Metabolites are the small biological molecules involved in
	            energy conversion and biosynthesis. Studying metabolism is
	            inherently challenging due to metabolites’ reactivity, structural
	            diversity, and broad concentration range. Herein, we review the
	            common pitfalls encountered in metabolomics and provide concrete
	            guidelines for obtaining accurate metabolite measurements,
	            focusing on water-soluble primary metabolites. We show how
	            seemingly straightforward sample preparation methods can
	            introduce systematic errors (e.g., owing to interconversion among
	            metabolites) and how proper selection of quenching solvent (e.g.,
	            acidic acetonitrile:methanol:water) can mitigate such problems.
	            We discuss the specific strengths, pitfalls, and best practices
	            for each common analytical platform: liquid chromatography-mass
	            spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
	            (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and enzyme assays.
	            Together this information provides a pragmatic knowledge base for
	            carrying out biologically informative metabolite measurements.},
